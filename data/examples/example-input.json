        "AbstractText": "Natural flavonoids are currently receiving much attention because of their estrogenic and antiestrogenic properties. Six isoflavones (isoprunetin, isoprunetin 7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, isoprunetin 4',7-di-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, genistein, genistein 7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, daidzein), four flavones (luteolin, luteolin 7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, luteolin 4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, licoflavone C), isolated from Genista morisii and G. ephedroides (two Leguminosae plants of the Mediterranean area) together with two structurally related pterocarpans, bitucarpin A and erybraedyn C, isolated from Bituminaria bituminosa (Leguminosae), were tested for the antagonist activity by a yeast based estrogen receptor assay (Saccharomyces cerevisiae RMY326 ER-ERE). Most compounds inhibited the estradiol-induced transcriptional activity in a concentration dependent manner. In particular, for the flavone luteolin 77% inhibition of the induced beta-galactosidase activity was observed. Interestingly, licoflavone C exhibited a dose-dependent antagonistic activity at concentrations up to 10(-4) M, but stimulated beta-galactosidase expression at higher concentrations resulting in a U-shaped-like dose-response curve.",

        "AbstractText": "Increased serum level of homocysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid, is considered a risk factor in vascular disorders and in dementias. The effect of homocysteine and metabolically related compounds on brain production of kynurenic acid (KYNA), an endogenous antagonist of glutamate ionotropic receptors, was studied. In rat cortical slices, DL-homocysteine enhanced (0.1-0.5 mM) or inhibited (concentration inducing 50% inhibition [IC50]=6.4 [5.5-7.5] mM) KYNA production. In vivo peripheral application of DL-homocysteine (1.3 mmol/kg intraperitoneally) increased KYNA content (pmol/g tissue) from 8.47 +/- 1.57 to 13.04 +/- 2.86 (P <0.01; 15 min) and 11.4 +/- 1.72 (P <0.01; 60 min) in cortex, and from 4.11 +/- 1.54 to 10.02 +/- 3.08 (P <0.01; 15 min) in rat hippocampus. High concentrations of DL-homocysteine (20 mM) applied via microdialysis probe decreased KYNA levels in rabbit hippocampus; this effect was antagonized partially by an antagonist of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors, LY367385. In vitro, S-adenosylhomocysteine acted similar to but more potently than DL-homocysteine, augmenting KYNA production at 0.03-0.08 mM and reducing it at > or =0.5 mM. The stimulatory effect of S-adenosylhomocysteine was abolished in the presence of the L-kynurenine uptake inhibitors L-leucine and L-phenyloalanine. Neither the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist CGS 19755 nor L-glycine influenced DL-homocysteine- and S-adenosylhomocysteine-induced changes of KYNA synthesis in vitro. DL-Homocysteine inhibited the activity of both KYNA biosynthetic enzymes, kynurenine aminotransferases (KATs) I and II, whereas S-adenosylhomocysteine reduced only the activity of KAT II. L-Methionine and L-cysteine, thiol-containing compounds metabolically related to homocysteine, acted only as weak inhibitors, reducing KYNA production in vitro and inhibiting the activity of KAT II (L-cysteine) or KAT I (L-methionine). The present data suggest that DL-homocysteine biphasically modulates KYNA synthesis. This seems to result from conversion of compound to S-adenosylhomocysteine, also acting dually on KYNA formation, and in part from the direct interaction of homocysteine with metabotropic glutamate receptors and KYNA biosynthetic enzymes. It seems probable that hyperhomocystemia-associated brain dysfunction is mediated partially by changes in brain KYNA level.",

        "AbstractText": "The five major apolar ecdysone esters present in newly laid eggs of the cattle tick Boophilus microplus have been purified by h.p.l.c. The quantities of the apolar esters present in the eggs were increased by administration of ecdysone to the mature females. G.c.-m.s. analysis, as their methyl esters, of the fatty acids released from the apolar ecdysone derivatives by alkali, coupled with positive-ion fast-atom-bombardment m.s. of the intact ecdysone esters, showed that the compounds consisted of a series of fatty acyl esters of ecdysone. The position of esterification of the ecdysone was established by p.m.r. spectroscopy. The combined data show that the novel apolar derivatives of ecdysone consist of the 22-palmitate, -palmitoleate, -stearate, -oleate, and -linoleate esters respectively. Confirmation was obtained by comparison with synthetic ecdysone 22-palmitate. The significance of the ecdysone fatty acyl esters as a possible source of free hormone during embryogenesis is discussed.",

        "AbstractText": "To isolate a key polyketide biosynthetic intermediate for the 16-membered macrolide FD-891 (1), we inactivated two biosynthetic genes coding for post-polyketide synthase (PKS) modification enzymes: a methyltransferase (GfsG) and a cytochrome P450 (GfsF). Consequently, FD-892 (2), which lacks the epoxide moiety at C8-C9, the hydroxy group at C10, and the O-methyl group at O-25 of FD-891, was isolated from the gfsF/gfsG double-knockout mutant. In addition, 25-O-methyl-FD-892 (3) and 25-O-demethyl-FD-891 (4) were isolated from the gfsF and gfsG mutants, respectively. We also confirmed that GfsG efficiently catalyzes the methylation of 2 and 4 in vitro. Further, GfsF catalyzed the epoxidation of the double bond at C8-C9 of 2 and 3 and subsequent hydroxylation at C10, to afford 4 and 1, respectively. These results suggest that a parallel post-PKS modification mechanism is involved in FD-891 biosynthesis.",

        "AbstractText": "In the course of our screening program for free radical scavengers from Trichoderma sp. USF-2690, we found an unidentified metabolite (1) that appeared by the method used for HPLC analysis. Metabolite 1 gradually decreased with the production of bisorbicillinoids and was easily missed during the general isolation procedure. The LC-ESI-MS (negative) analysis for 1 gave m/z 247 as the (M-1)- ion peak. The hydrolysis of synthetic 6-O-acetylsorbicillinol (+/- -2) by 0.05 M KOH and acetylation of product 1 in an aqueous solution indicated that the structure of 1 was (6S)-4-(2,4-hexadienoyl)-3,6-dihydroxy-2,6-dimethyl-2,4-cyclohexadien-1-one, designated sorbicillinol, a quinol that has been postulated to be important in bisorbicillinoid biosynthesis.",

The planar structures of the new compounds were established by 1D-, 2D-NMR, and MS analyses.

The chemical structures of these sesquiterpenoids were elucidated on the basis of HR-ESI-MS and NMR data including 1H, 13C, HSQC, 1H-1H COSY, HMBC, and NOESY spectra, and the absolute configurations of these compounds were determined using a modified Mosher's method and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy. A possible biosynthetic pathway of these guaiane-type sesquiterpenoids is discussed, and proposed that post-modification oxidative enzymes might form these highly polyhydroxylated structures. Compound 1 displayed biological effects on the root growth of Arabidopsis thaliana, and SW displayed cytotoxicity against A549 and HeLa cancer cell lines.",

In this article, four high-content components including deoxyaconitine, benzoylaconine, aconine and neoline were isolated by using column chromatography. HPLC-MS(n)was employed to deduce the regulations of fragmentation of diterpenoid alkaloids which displayed a characteristic behavior of loss of CO(28u), CH3COOH(60u), CH3OH(32u), H2O(18u) and C6H5COOH(122u). Then, according to fragmentation regulation of mass spectrometry, 42 alkaloids were found inA. pendulum Among them, 38 compounds were identified and 29 alkaloids were reported for the first time for this herb. Therefore, this means that HPLC-MS(n)combined with column chromatography could work as an effective and reliable tool for rapid identification of the chemical components of herbal medicine.",

Their chemical structures and relative stereochemistry were elucidated by the analysis of HRMS and 2-D NMR spectroscopic data. The steroids 1 and 2 showed notable inhibitory activity against farnesoid X-activated receptor (FXR) with IC(50)'s 14 and 15\u03bcM.",
