Two sesterterpenoids (compound 1, 2) and two diterpenoids (compound 3, 4) were isolated using various chromatographic techniques. The cytotoxic activity of these compounds was evaluated against the NCI's 60 cell-line screen using the soft agar assay. Compound 1 showed moderate inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 3.72 \u03bcM, while compound 2 displayed weak cytotoxic properties. In addition, compounds 3 and 4 exhibited no cytotoxicity against any of the NCI cell lines tested. To assess their potential in vivo activity, a subcutaneous tumor model using Balb/c mice was established. The results indicate that both sesterterpenoids (compound 1) significantly inhibited tumor growth with an IC50 value of 27 mg/kg. This study provides new insights into the potential use of marine sponge-derived ent-compounds as cytotoxic agents against various types of cancer cells, and additional studies are needed to confirm their efficacy in vivo.",

In this study, we report the isolation and cytotoxic evaluation of four norterpene peroxides (nuciferine, isomannitol, nuapapuin A, and nuapapuin B) from the marine sponge Diacarnus spinipoculum. The compounds were evaluated using the NCI's 60 cell-line screen and soft agar assay to determine their cytotoxic properties. Nuapapuin A, nuapapuin B, (+)-epi-Muqubillin A, and (-)-muqubilin A showed significant inhibitory effects on the NCI's 60 cell line screen at low micromolar concentrations. The compounds were also evaluated for their ability to induce apoptosis and inhibit colony formation in soft agar assays. Nuapapuin A, nuapapuin B, (+)-epi-Muqubillin A, and (-)-muqubilin A demonstrated significant cytotoxic properties against multiple cancer cell lines. In vivo evaluation of the compounds is currently underway to determine their potential as therapeutic agents for cancer treatment.",

The structures of these compounds were elucidated as 3\u03b2-hydroxy-24-methylene-20(21)-lanost-23-en-19-oic acid (eryloside G) and 3\u03b2-acetyl-24-methylene-20(21)-lanost-23-en-19-oic acid (eryloside H) by the combined chemical and spectral analyses, as well as 3\u03b2-hydroxy-24-isopropylidene-20(21)-lanost-23-en-19-oic acid (eryloside I), 3\u03b2-acetyl-24-methoxy-20(21)-lanost-23-en-19-oic acid (eryloside J) by spectral analysis. The compounds were tested for their cytotoxicity against the human leukemia cell line, KB cells and showed significant inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 8.4 and 7.6 \u03bcM, respectively. These findings suggest that lanostane-based modified penasterols might be potential lead compounds for the development of new anti-cancer drugs.",

The structures of the new compounds were elucidated as lanostane-based modified penasterols through a combination of chemical and spectral analyses, including 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, HR-ESIMS, CD, and comparison with previously reported data. The cytotoxicity of the new compounds was evaluated against two human leukemia cell lines (K562 and MOLM-13) using a resazurin assay. The results indicated that erylosides G-J exhibited significant cytotoxic activities, with IC50 values ranging from 4.2 to 8.9 \u03bcM. These findings suggest that the new triterpenoid saponins might be potential candidates for use in cancer therapy.",

The structure of these compounds was elucidated by NMR, HRMS, and comparison with literature data. Compound 1 exhibited potent antiinvasive activity against human cancer cells (A549 and MDA-MB-231), with an IC50 value of 7.68 and 12.23 \u03bcM, respectively. Compound 2 showed potent antimetastatic activity against MDA-MB-231 cells, with an IC50 value of 24.90 \u03bcM. The results suggest that U-77863 and U-77864 could be potential antiinvasive/antimetastatic agents for the treatment of cancer.",
