Isolation and cytotoxic evaluation of marine sponge-derived norterpene peroxides. The study aimed to isolate and evaluate the cytotoxic properties of ent-compounds derived from marine sponge Diacarnus spinipoculum. Two sesterterpenoids (compound 1, 2) and two diterpenoids (compound 3, 4) were isolated using various chromatographic techniques. The cytotoxic activity of these compounds was evaluated against the NCI's 60 cell-line screen using the soft agar assay. Compound 1 showed moderate inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 3.72 μM, while compound 2 displayed weak cytotoxic properties. In addition, compounds 3 and 4 exhibited no cytotoxicity against any of the NCI cell lines tested. To assess their potential in vivo activity, a subcutaneous tumor model using Balb/c mice was established. The results indicate that both sesterterpenoids (compound 1) significantly inhibited tumor growth with an IC50 value of 27 mg/kg. This study provides new insights into the potential use of marine sponge-derived ent-compounds as cytotoxic agents against various types of cancer cells, and additional studies are needed to confirm their efficacy in vivo.

Isolation and cytotoxic evaluation of marine sponge-derived norterpene peroxides. Marine sponge-derived compounds have been the focus of much research due to their potential as a source of new bioactive molecules. In this study, we report the isolation and cytotoxic evaluation of four norterpene peroxides (nuciferine, isomannitol, nuapapuin A, and nuapapuin B) from the marine sponge Diacarnus spinipoculum. The compounds were evaluated using the NCI's 60 cell-line screen and soft agar assay to determine their cytotoxic properties. Nuapapuin A, nuapapuin B, (+)-epi-Muqubillin A, and (-)-muqubilin A showed significant inhibitory effects on the NCI's 60 cell line screen at low micromolar concentrations. The compounds were also evaluated for their ability to induce apoptosis and inhibit colony formation in soft agar assays. Nuapapuin A, nuapapuin B, (+)-epi-Muqubillin A, and (-)-muqubilin A demonstrated significant cytotoxic properties against multiple cancer cell lines. In vivo evaluation of the compounds is currently underway to determine their potential as therapeutic agents for cancer treatment.

New triterpenoid saponins from the sponge Erylus nobilis. Two new lanostane-based modified penasterols, named erylosides G-J, were isolated from the sponge Erylus nobilis collected in Jaeju Island, Korea. The structures of these compounds were elucidated as 3β-hydroxy-24-methylene-20(21)-lanost-23-en-19-oic acid (eryloside G) and 3β-acetyl-24-methylene-20(21)-lanost-23-en-19-oic acid (eryloside H) by the combined chemical and spectral analyses, as well as 3β-hydroxy-24-isopropylidene-20(21)-lanost-23-en-19-oic acid (eryloside I), 3β-acetyl-24-methoxy-20(21)-lanost-23-en-19-oic acid (eryloside J) by spectral analysis. The compounds were tested for their cytotoxicity against the human leukemia cell line, KB cells and showed significant inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 8.4 and 7.6 μM, respectively.
