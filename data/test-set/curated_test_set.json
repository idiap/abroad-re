        "AbstractText": "Two new compounds, pestalotin 4'-O-methyl-\u03b2-mannopyranoside (1) and 3S,4R-(+)-4-hydroxymellein (2), were isolated from an organic extract of a Xylaria feejeensis, which was isolated as an endophytic fungus from Hintonia latiflora. In addition, the known compounds 3S,4S-(+)-4-hydroxymellein (3), 3S-(+)-8-methoxymellein (4), and the quinone derivatives 2-hydroxy-5-methoxy-3-methylcyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione (5), 4S,5S,6S-4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-5-methyl-5,6-epoxycyclohex-2-en-1-one (6), and 4R,5R-dihydroxy-3-methoxy-5-methylcyclohexen-2-en-1-one (7) were obtained. The structures of 1 and 2 were elucidated using a set of spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques. The absolute configuration of the stereogenic centers of 1 and 2 was determined using ECD spectroscopy combined with time-dependent density functional theory calculations. In the case of 1, comparison of the experimental and theoretical (3)J6-7 coupling constants provided further evidence for the stereochemical assignments. Compounds 2 and 3 inhibited Saccharomyces cerevisiae \u03b1-glucosidase (\u03b1GHY), with IC50 values of 441 \u00b1 23 and 549 \u00b1 2.5 \u03bcM, respectively. Their activity was comparable to that of acarbose (IC50 = 545 \u00b1 19 \u03bcM), used as positive control. Molecular docking predicted that both compounds bind to \u03b1GHY in a site different from the catalytic domain, which could imply an allosteric type of inhibition.",

The structures of these new compounds, designated as sarasinosides N-R (9-13), were determined by combined spectroscopic and chemical methods. The aglycone portions of 10-13 were found to be unprecedented among nortriterpeneoids on the basis of extensive NMR analyses. Several of these compounds exhibited cytotoxicity against A549 and K562 cell lines as well as weak inhibitory activity against Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase.",

        "AbstractText": "Fifteen illudalane sesquiterpenoids, alcyopterosins A-O (1-15) have been isolated from the subAntarctic soft coral Alcyonium paessleri which was collected at a depth of 200 m near the South Georgia Islands, and their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic techniques. Eight of these compounds (2, 3, 5-8, 10, and 13) are the first natural nitrate esters, while the other four (1, 4, 11, and 12) are chlorinated. These compounds are as well the first illudalane sesquiterpenoids to be isolated from the marine environment. Compounds 1, 3, 5, and 8 showed mild cytotoxicity toward human tumor cell lines.",

These compounds were chemically converted to a known compound, eudistomin Y(1) (7) and six new derivatives, designated eudistomins Y(8)-Y(13) (8-13). Several of these natural and synthetic compounds exhibited moderate to significant antimicrobial activity, weak cytotoxic activity, and inhibitory activities toward sortase A, isocitrate lyase, and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. Structure-activity relationships were also deduced.",

Eight of these compounds (\u03b2)-elemene,\u03b2-caryophyllene,\u03b1-humulene,\u03b1-muurolene,\u03b3-selinene,\u03b2-selinene, germacrene-A, and \u03b32-cadinene) were identified by GC and GC-MS (EI). Two uncommon sesquiterpenes, (5R(*), 7R(*), 10S(*))-selina-4(14),11-diene and (5R(*), 7R(*), 10S(*))-selina-3,11-diene, were identified by GC, GC-MS (EI, CI), GC-FTIR, and mono- and bidimensional NMR. Whereas in most species sesquiterpenes are present in low or trace amounts, inN. novarumhebridarum the sesquiterpenic fraction of soldier frontal gland secretion is equal to that of the monoterpenes.",

Their structures were determined by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. Since treatment of elaeocarpenine (1) with ammonia produced a 1:1 mixture of the diastereomers 3 and 4, we propose that elaeocarpenine (1) is the biogenetic precursor of isoelaeocarpine (3) and elaeocarpine (4). Compounds 1-4 demonstrated binding affinity for the human delta-opioid receptor with IC50 values of 2.7, 35.1, 13.6, and 86.4 microM, respectively.",

Six additional demethyl sterols and five additional 4-monomethyl sterols which remain unidentified were also detected. Lipid extracts of M. californica from a winter and summer collection were split by various chromatographic methods into free sterol, steryl ester, and steryl conjugate fractions. Sterol compositions (determined by CG and CG-MS) of each fraction, subsequent to hydrolysis, are tabulated and discussed with respect to plausible origins of observed variations. The possible relationship of the Muricea 19-nor-steroidal ketone to other naturally occurring 19-nor-steroids is discussed.",

Most of the new compounds contain one to three O-sulfate units. Their structures were determined by extensive spectroscopic analysis including (1)H and (13)C NMR (COSY, HMQC, HMBC) and ESIMS data. A possible pathway for the biosynthetic origin of the isolated alkaloids is proposed, in which DOPA is assumed to be a joint biogenetic precursor. Baculiferins C, E-H, and K-N (4, 6-9, 12-15) were found to be potent inhibitors against the HIV-1 IIIB virus in both, MT4 and MAGI cells. Additional bioassay revealed that baculiferins could dramatically bind to the HIV-1 target proteins Vif, APOBEC3G, and gp41, for which structure-activity relationships are discussed.",

        "AbstractText": "Ralstonia solanacearum is a major phytopathogenic bacterium that attacks many crops and other plants around the world. In this study, a novel actinomycete, designated strain NEAU-SSA 1T, which exhibited antibacterial activity against Ralstonia solanacearum, was isolated from soil collected from Mount Song and characterized using a polyphasic approach. Morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics of the strain coincided with those of the genus Streptomyces. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that the isolate was most closely related to Streptomyces aureoverticillatus JCM 4347T (97.9%). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the strain formed a cluster with Streptomyces vastus JCM4524T (97.4%), S. cinereus DSM43033T (97.2%), S. xiangluensis NEAU-LA29T (97.1%) and S. flaveus JCM3035T (97.1%). The cell wall contained LL-diaminopimelic acid and the whole-cell hydrolysates were ribose, mannose and galactose. The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), hydroxy-phosphatidylethanolamine (OH-PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), two phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs) and an unidentified phospholipid (PL). The menaquinones were MK-9(H4), MK-9(H6), and MK-9(H8). The major fatty acids were iso-C17:0, C16:0 and C17:1 \u03c99c. The DNA G+C content was 69.9 mol %. However, multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on five other house-keeping genes (atpD, gyrB, recA, rpoB, and trpB), DNA-DNA relatedness, and physiological and biochemical data showed that the strain could be distinguished from its closest relatives. Therefore, it is proposed that strain NEAU-SSA 1T should be classified as representatives of a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces sporangiiformans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NEAU-SSA 1T (=CCTCC AA 2017028T = DSM 105692T).",

The patients were middle-aged, and their average exposure time was 13 years. The plant families and plants causing occupational contact dermatitis were Compositae (5 patients; chrysanthemum, elecampane, gerbera, feverfew), Alstroemeriaceae (5 patients, Alstroemeria), Liliaceae (4 patients; tulip, hyacinth), Amaryllidaceae (2 patients; narcissus) and Caryophyllaceae (2 patients; carnation, cauzeflower). The known chemical allergens causing dermatitis were tuliposide-A and sesquiterpene lactones, such as alantolactones and parthenolide, in the Liliaceae and Compositae families. 7 of the 12 patients were able to continue their work; 5 were not because of severe relapses of skin symptoms. The plant allergen and extract series currently available are of great help in the diagnosis.",

        "AbstractText": "Since 1980, over a dozen novel brominated alkaloids, named flustramines, have been isolated from Scandinavian and Canadian collections of the marine bryozoan Flustra foliacea. This paper describes the reisolation of the known compound dihydroflustramine C (1) and the isolation of 11 new flustramines (2-4, 6-13), including two dimers (12, 13) that may be isolation artifacts. Together these compounds, some with an unexpected aryl substitution pattern, reveal an intricate network of metabolites present in the extracts of the bryozoan. The structures of these metabolites were solved using a variety of spectroscopic techniques and chemical derivatization and modification. This work also led to the recognition of an unusual rearrangement reaction that occurred slowly over a number of years.",

        "AbstractText": "Fourteen new compounds, oudemansins 1-4, oudemansinols 5-7, favolasins 8-10, favolasinin (12), polyketides 13-15, and (R,E)-2,4-dimethyl-5-phenyl-4-pentene-2,3-diol (16), together with nine known compounds were isolated from the basidiomycete fungus Favolaschia sp. BCC 18686. Two new compounds, favolasin E (11) and 9-oxostrobilurin E (17), were isolated from the closely related organism Favolaschia calocera BCC 36684 along with nine \u03b2-methoxyacrylate-type derivatives. Compounds in the class of oudemansins and strobilurins exhibited moderate to strong antimalarial activity with relatively low cytotoxicity against Vero cells (African green monkey kidney fibroblasts). Potent antimalarial activity was demonstrated for 9-methoxystrobilurins G, K, and E (IC50 values 0.061, 0.089, and 0.14 \u03bcM, respectively). The structure-activity relationships (SAR) for antimalarial activity is proposed on the basis of the activity of the new and several known \u03b2-methoxyacrylate derivatives in combination with the data from previously isolated compounds. Furthermore, several compounds showed specific cytotoxicity against NCI-187 cells (human small-cell lung cancer), although the SAR was different from that for antimalarial activity.",

        "AbstractText": "Mature thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFIa) is a carboxypeptidase that stabilizes fibrin clots by removing C-terminal arginines and lysines from partially degraded fibrin. Inhibition of TAFIa stimulates the degradation of fibrin clots and may help to prevent thrombosis. Applying a lead finding approach based on literature-mining, we discovered that anabaenopeptins, cyclic peptides produced by cyanobacteria, were potent inhibitors of TAFIa with IC50 values as low as 1.5\u2009nM. We describe the isolation and structure elucidation of 20 anabaenopeptins, including 13 novel congeners, as well as their pronounced structure-activity relationships (SAR) with respect to inhibition of TAFIa. Crystal structures of the anabaenopeptins B, C and F bound to the surrogate protease carboxypeptidase B revealed the binding modes of these large (~850\u2009Da) compounds in detail and explained the observed SAR, i.e. the strong dependence of the potency on a basic (Arg, Lys) exocyclic residue that addressed the S1' binding pocket, and a broad tolerance towards substitutions in the pentacyclic ring that acted as a plug of the active site.",

The inhibitory mechanism of 1 and 3 on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells was investigated; we found that the mRNA and protein expression levels of SREBP-1c were reduced by treatment with 1 and 3 versus the untreated control. Furthermore, compounds 1 and 3 suppressed the mRNA expression levels of FAS and ACC. These results demonstrate that inhibition of adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells by treatment with 1 and 3 may be mediated in part through down-regulation of the adipogenic transcription factor SREBP-1c and its target genes, such as FAS and ACC.",

        "AbstractText": "Bacteria can produce a wide variety of volatile compounds. Many of these volatiles carry oxygen, while nitrogen-containing volatiles are less frequently observed. We report here on the identification and synthesis of new nitrogen-containing volatiles from Salinispora pacifica CNS863 and explore the occurrence in another bacterial lineage, exemplified by Roseobacter-group bacteria. Several compound classes not reported before from bacteria were identified, such as dialkyl ureas and oxalamides. Sulfinamides have not been reported before as natural products. The actinomycete S. pacifica CNS863 produces, for example, sulfinamides N-isobutyl- and N-isopentylmethanesulfinamide (5, 6), urea N,N'-diisobutylurea (16), and oxalamide N,N'-diisobutyloxalamide (17). In addition, new imines such as (E)-1-(furan-2-yl)-N-(2-methylbutyl)methanimine (8) and (E)-2-((isobutylimino)methyl)phenol (13) were identified together with several other imines, acetamides, and formamides. Some of these compounds including the sulfinamides were also released by the Roseobacter-group bacteria Roseovarius pelophilus G5II, Pseudoruegeria sp. SK021, and Phaeobacter gallaeciensis BS107, although generally fewer compounds were detected. These nitrogen-containing volatiles seem to originate from biogenic amines derived from the amino acids valine, leucine, and isoleucine.",

        "AbstractText": "Fourteen new compounds including thirteen drimane - phthalide derivatives (fendlerals A - C, fendlerins A - D, fendlerols A - B, fendleric acids A - C, fendlerinine G) and one terphenyl derivative (fendleryl E) along with eight known compounds, fendlerinine A, rickenyls C - D, fendleryls C - D, atromentin, tetramethyl atromentin, and (\u00b1)-microsphaerophthalide F, were isolated from the wood fungus Hypoxylon fendleri BCC32408. Compared with the prior work, the results indicated the agitation effect on the production of bioactive drimane - phthalides. The chemical structures were determined based upon spectroscopic analyses and the absolute configurations were verified by comparison of the ECD spectral data with the calculated ECD spectra of the related compounds. Compounds 1-3 exhibited antimicrobial activity against Plasmodium falciparum (IC50 4.15-4.39\u202f\u03bcM), Colletotrichum capsici (MIC 6.25-12.5\u202f\u03bcg/mL), and Bacillus cereus (MIC 1.56-3.13\u202f\u03bcg/mL). All tested compounds displayed broad cytotoxicity against cancerous (MCF-7, KB, and NCI-H187) and non-cancerous (Vero) cells.",

        "AbstractText": "A new polyacetylene, gymnasterkoreayne G (1) and seven known (2--8) constituents were isolated from the leaves of Gymnaster koraiensis. Base on extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic data, the structure of the new compound was identified as erythro-8(S)-9(Z),16-heptadecadiene-4,6-diyne-2,3,8-triol. Isolated compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit NFAT transcription factor. While other components did not show activity, most of polyacetylene components markedly inhibit NFAT transcription factor. Of these compounds, gymnasterkoreayne B (3) was the most potent (IC(50) 1.44+/-0.59 microM). In term of the isomers, compound 1 (IC(50) 43.9+/-2.24 microM) with an erythro-configuration showed less inhibition than 2 (IC(50) 7.24+/-0.42 microM) with a threo-configuration.",

        "AbstractText": "Chemical examination of an EtOAc extract of a cultured Acremonium sp. fungus from deep-sea sediments resulted in the isolation of 15 new eremophilane-type sesquiterpenoids, namely, acremeremophilanes A-O (1-15), together with seven known analogues. The structures of new compounds were determined through extensive spectroscopic analyses, in association with chemical conversions and ECD calculations for configurational assignments. The PKS-derived 4-hexenoic acid unit in 2-6 is rarely found in nature. All compounds were evaluated for inhibitory effects toward nitric oxide production induced by lipopolysaccharide in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. Compounds 2-6 and 14 exhibited inhibitory effects with IC50 values ranging from 8 to 45 \u03bcM.",

        "AbstractText": "The effectiveness of Curcuma drugs against \"Oketsu\" and the differences in their efficacy were evaluated by examining their vasomotional effects as one index. Since nitric oxide (NO) is the relaxation factor of vascular smooth muscle and also an inhibitor of platelet aggregation in blood vessels, substances showing NO-dependent relaxation are thought to be effective in improving Oketsu. In this study, five Curcuma drugs derived from Curcuma longa, C. kwangsiensis, C. phaeocaulis, C. wenyujin, and C. zedoaria were used. Methanol extracts exhibited intense effects on relaxation in rings precontracted by prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PGF(2alpha)) despite pretreatment with and without N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) as an inhibitor of NO synthesis. The maximal activities were approximately 80% at 10(-3) g/ml. From these methanol extracts, curcumin and eight sesquiterpenes were isolated. Since all these compounds showed NO-independent relaxation effects with almost the same intensities, the relaxation effects of Curcuma drugs can be estimated by the total amounts of curcumin and sesquiterpenes. Polysaccharides, the main constituents of methanol-insoluble compounds of water extracts, in contrast, showed contraction effects; only polysaccharides in C. zedoaria showed NO-dependent relaxation as well as contraction. All water extracts showed relaxation effects as sum of the methanol-soluble compounds-induced relaxation and polysaccharides-induced contraction. Therefore, all Curcuma drugs tested in the present study can be effective for vasodilation. Moreover, the drug derived from C. zedoaria has potential to cure Oketsu with its various acting points.",

        "AbstractText": "Sequencing the actinomycin (acm) biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces antibioticus IMRU 3720, which produces actinomycin X (Acm X), revealed 20 genes organized into a highly similar framework as in the bi-armed acm C biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces chrysomallus but without an attached additional extra arm of orthologues as in the latter. Curiously, the extra arm of the S. chrysomallus gene cluster turned out to perfectly match the single arm of the S. antibioticus gene cluster in the same order of orthologues including the the presence of two pseudogenes, scacmM and scacmN, encoding a cytochrome P450 and its ferredoxin, respectively. Orthologues of the latter genes were both missing in the principal arm of the S. chrysomallus acm C gene cluster. All orthologues of the extra arm showed a G +C-contents different from that of their counterparts in the principal arm. Moreover, the similarities of translation products from the extra arm were all higher to the corresponding translation products of orthologue genes from the S. antibioticus acm X gene cluster than to those encoded by the principal arm of their own gene cluster. This suggests that the duplicated structure of the S. chrysomallus acm C biosynthetic gene cluster evolved from previous fusion between two one-armed acm gene clusters each from a different genetic background. However, while scacmM and scacmN in the extra arm of the S. chrysomallus acm C gene cluster are mutated and therefore are non-functional, their orthologues saacmM and saacmN in the S. antibioticus acm C gene cluster show no defects seemingly encoding active enzymes with functions specific for Acm X biosynthesis. Both acm biosynthetic gene clusters lack a kynurenine-3-monooxygenase gene necessary for biosynthesis of 3-hydroxy-4-methylanthranilic acid, the building block of the Acm chromophore, which suggests participation of a genome-encoded relevant monooxygenase during Acm biosynthesis in both S. chrysomallus and S. antibioticus.",

        "AbstractText": "We report a new Streptomyces species named S. formicae that was isolated from the African fungus-growing plant-ant Tetraponera penzigi and show that it produces novel pentacyclic polyketides that are active against MRSA and VRE. The chemical scaffold of these compounds, which we have called the formicamycins, is similar to the fasamycins identified from the heterologous expression of clones isolated from environmental DNA, but has significant differences that allow the scaffold to be decorated with up to four halogen atoms. We report the structures and bioactivities of 16 new molecules and show, using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, that biosynthesis of these compounds is encoded by a single type 2 polyketide synthase biosynthetic gene cluster in the S. formicae genome. Our work has identified the first antibiotic from the Tetraponera system and highlights the benefits of exploring unusual ecological niches for new actinomycete strains and novel natural products.",

        "AbstractText": "Streptomyces cyanogenus S-136 is the producer of previously reported landomycins A-D. An analysis of minor products of the strain led to isolation and structure elucidation of eight new congeners, named landomycins P-W (5, 6, 3, 17, 9, 10, 15, 7), along with 10 other known angucyclin(on)es. The structures of the new compounds were established from their NMR and mass spectrometry data. The activity of these angucyclin(on)es was determined using MCF-7 (estrogen responsive) and MDA-231 (estrogen refractory) breast cancer cell lines. Cell viability assays showed that anhydrolandomycinone (2), landomycinone (11), and landomycin A (16) showed the best combined activities in both MCF-7 and MDA-231 assays, with 2 being the most potent in the former and 11 and 16 in the latter. These data reveal that some of the aglycones are equipotent to the principle product 16, which contains the longest saccharide chain. Specifically, anhydrolandomycinone (2) was the most active against MCF-7 cells (IC(50) = 1.8 \u03bcM). Compounds with shorter saccharidal moieties were less potent against MCF-7. The fact that the most active landomycins have either long penta- or hexasaccharide chains or no sugars at all suggests that the large compounds may act by a different mode of action than their small sugar-free congeners. The results presented here provide more insights into the structure-activity relationship of landomycins.",

        "AbstractText": "1. De novo sterol biosynthesis in the sponges Tethya aurantia and Aplysina fistularis was investigated, using sodium [5,5-3H]-mevalonate, [1-3H]-farnesol and [3-3H]-squalene. [3-3H]-Squalene was found to be the best precursor for demonstrating de novo sterol biosynthesis in a wider range of sponges. 2. By feeding [3-3H]-squalene and using cell-free techniques, the de novo sterol biosynthesis was established in 18 sponges belonging to nine orders. Among these sponges were Axinella polypoides and Axinella verrucosa which had previously been thought to be incapable of de novo sterol biosynthesis based on work with radiolabeled lanosterol, cycloartenol, mevalonate, and acetate. 3. In contrast to earlier assumptions, it is likely that all sponges are capable of de novo sterol biosynthesis.",

        "AbstractText": "Six new isocoumarin derivatives, exserolides A-F (1-6), were isolated from solid cultures of the plant endophytic fungus Exserohilum sp., together with four known metabolites (7-10). The structures of 1-6 were elucidated primarily by NMR experiments. The absolute configuration of the C-3 methine carbon in 1-5 was deduced via the circular dichroism data, whereas that of the 1,3-diol moiety in 6 was assigned from the (1)H NMR data of its (R)- and (S)-MTPA diesters. Compounds 3 and 9 showed antifungal activity against the plant pathogen Fusarium oxysporum, whereas 6 displayed significant inhibitory effects against a small panel of bacteria.",

        "AbstractText": "Panax pseudo-ginseng subsp. pseudo-ginseng has a carrot like root with a small rhizome. It was shown that the saponin composition of roots and rhizomes of this subspecies collected in Tibet and China was extremely poor. From the roots and rhizomes collected in Central Nepal, (specimen-PNct), only a small amount of an oleanolic acid saponin, beta-D-glucopyranosyl-oleanolate (2) was isolated together with a polyacetylene-alcohol, panaxynol (3). In another specimen (specimen-PNs), also collected in Central Nepal, two oleanolic acid saponins, stipleanoside R2 (4) and chikusetsusaponin IV (5) were detected. No dammarane saponin was identified in either specimen. P. pseudo-ginseng subsp. himalaicus (Subsp-H) has a big rhizome with a small round root. From rhizomes and roots of this subsp. collected in Central Nepal (specimen-HNct), a fairly large amount of dammarane saponins, ginsenosides-Rb1 (6), -Rd (7), -Re (9) and -Rg1 (10), gypenoside XVII (8), notoginsenoside-R1 (11), majonoside-R2 (12) and pseudo-ginsenoside-F11 (13) were isolated, while no oleanane saponin (oleanolic acid saponin) was identified in this subsp. Based on the present and previous studies, medicinal evaluation and chemogeographical correlation of Himalayan Panax spp. are discussed.",

        "AbstractText": "The volatiles released by agar plate cultures of two strains of the myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca (strains Sg a15 and DW4/3-1) were collected in a closed-loop stripping apparatus (CLSA) and analyzed by GC-MS. Large numbers of substances from different compound classes (ketones, esters, lactones, terpenes, and sulfur and nitrogen compounds) were identified; several of them are reported from natural sources for the first time. The volatiles 2-methyltridecan-4-one (17), its isomer 3-methyltridecan-4-one (20), and the higher homologue 2-methyltetradecan-4-one (18) were identified in the extracts of both strains and were synthesized. In addition, strain Sg a15 produced 2,12-dimethyltridecan-4-one (19), 2-methyltridec-2-en-4-one (23), and a series of phenyl ketones, among them 1-phenyldecan-1-one (14) and 9-methyl-1-phenyldecan-1-one (16), whereas strain DW4/3-1 emitted traces of 10-methylundecan-2-one (21). The biosynthesis of 14 and 16 was examined in feeding experiments with deuterated precursors carried out on agar plate cultures. The leucine-derived starter unit isovalerate was shown to be incorporated into 16, as was phenylalanine-derived benzoic acid into both 14 and 16. The results point to formation both of the phenyl ketones and of the structurally related aliphatic ketones through an unusual head-to-head coupling between a starter unit such as benzoyl-CoA and a fatty acyl-CoA, followed by decarboxylation.",

        "AbstractText": "Phenolic acids are important phenolic compounds widespread in foods, contributing to nutritional and organoleptic properties. The bioavailability of these compounds depends on their free or conjugated presence in food matrices, which is also affected by food processing. Phenolic acids undergo metabolism by the host and residing intestinal microbiota, which causes conjugations and structural modifications of the compounds. Human responses, metabolite profiles and health responses of phenolics, show considerable individual variation, which\u00a0is affected by absorption, metabolism and genetic variations of subjects. A better understanding of the gut-host interplay and microbiome biochemistry is becoming highly relevant in understanding the impact of diet and its constituents. It is common to study metabolism and health benefits separately, with some exceptions; however, it should be preferred that health responders and non-responders are studied in combination with explanatory metabolite profiles and gene variants. This approach could turn interindividual variation from a problem in human research to an asset for research on personalized nutrition.",

Thus, a new \u03b2-carboline alkaloid, 6-hydroxymetatacarboline D (1d), was isolated from fruiting bodies of M. metata. 6-Hydroxymetatacarboline D consists of a highly substituted \u03b2-carboline skeleton, which is likely to be derived biosynthetically from l-tryptophan, 2-oxoglutaric acid, l-threonine, and l-proline. The structure of the alkaloid was established by 2D NMR spectroscopic methods and HR-ESIMS. Moreover, by extensive application of LC-HR-ESIMS, LC-HR-ESIMS/MS, and LC-HR-ESIMS(3) techniques we were able to elucidate the structures of a number of accompanying \u03b2-carboline alkaloids, 1a-1c, 1e-1i, and 2a-2g, structurally closely related to 6-hydroxymetatacarboline D, which are present in M. metata in minor amounts. The absolute configuration of the stereogenic centers of the \u03b2-carboline alkaloids was determined by GC-MS comparison with authentic synthetic samples after hydrolytic cleavage and derivatization of the resulting amino acids.",

        "AbstractText": "The metabolism of l-menthone, which is synthesized in the epidermal oil glands of peppermint (Mentha piperita L. cv. Black Mitcham) leaves, is compartmented; on leaf maturity, this ketone is converted to l-menthol and l-menthyl acetate in one compartment, and to d-neomenthol and d-neomenthyl glucoside in a separate compartment. All of the enzymes involved in these reactions are soluble when prepared from whole-leaf homogenates. Mechanical separation of epidermal fragments from the mesophyll, followed by preparation of the soluble enzyme fraction from each tissue, revealed that the neomenthol dehydrogenase and the glucosyl transferase resided specifically in the mesophyll layer, whereas the menthol dehydrogenase and substantial amounts of the acetyl transferase were located in the epidermis, presumably within the epidermal oil glands. These results suggest that the compartmentation of menthone metabolism in peppermint leaves is intercellular, not intracellular.",

        "AbstractText": "The \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity of an aqueous extract and compounds from the aerial parts of V. corymbosa was demonstrated with yeast and rat small intestinal \u03b1-glucosidases. The aqueous extract inhibited yeast \u03b1-glucosidase with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 28.6 \u03bcg/mL. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the extract led to the isolation of several compounds, including one cyanogenic glycoside [prunasin (1)], five flavonoids [(-)-epi-catechin (2), hyperoside (3), isoquercetin (4), quercitrin (5) and quercetin-3-O-(6''-benzoyl)-\u03b2-galactoside (6)] and two simple aromatic compounds [picein (7) and methylarbutin (8)]. The most active compound was 6 with IC50 values of 30 \u03bcM in the case of yeast \u03b1-glucosidase, and 437 \u03bcM in the case of the mammalian enzyme. According to the kinetic analyses performed with rat and yeast enzymes, this compound behaved as mixed-type inhibitor; the calculated inhibition constants (Ki) were 212 and 50 \u03bcM, respectively. Molecular docking analyses with yeast and mammalian \u03b1-glucosidases revealed that compound 6 bind differently to these enzymes. Altogether, the results of this work suggest that preparations of V. corymbosa might delay glucose absorption in vivo.",

        "AbstractText": "Chemical investigations of two collections of the deep reef Caribbean sponge Plakortis angulospiculatus resulted in the isolation of a new compound (1) along with the known compound spiculoic acid B (2) belonging to the spiculoic acid class and four other new compounds (3-6) belonging to the zyggomphic acid class. Three new aromatic compounds (7-9) were isolated from the Caribbean sponge Plakortis halichondrioides. The structural determination of the compounds was based on extensive NMR and mass spectroscopic analysis. The isolated compounds 1-7 were tested for their anti-inflammatory activity using in vitro assays for inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase and nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB) activity, as well as inhibition of intracellular reactive oxygen species generation as a result of oxidative stress. The cytotoxicity of these compounds was also evaluated to determine the selectivity index of their bioactivity with respect to cytotoxicity. Compounds 1 and 4 were more potent than the positive control in inhibiting NF\u03baB activity and had IC(50) values of 0.47 and 2.28 \u03bcM, respectively.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Influence of electron transport proteins on the reactions catalyzed by Fusarium fujikuroi gibberellin monooxygenases.",
        "AbstractText": "The multifunctional cytochrome P450 monooxygenases P450-1 and P450-2 from Fusarium fujikuroi catalyze the formation of GA14 and GA4, respectively, in the gibberellin (GA)-biosynthetic pathway. However, the activity of these enzymes is qualitatively and quantitatively different in mutants lacking the NADPH:cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CPR) compared to CPR-containing strains. 3beta-Hydroxylation, a major P450-1 activity in wild-type strains, was strongly decreased in the mutants relative to oxidation at C-6 and C-7, while synthesis of C19-GAs as a result of oxidative cleavage of C-20 by P450-2 was almost absent whereas the C-20 alcohol, aldehyde and carboxylic acid derivatives accumulated. Interaction of the monooxygenases with alternative electron transport proteins could account for these different product distributions. In the absence of CPR, P450-1 activities were NADH-dependent, and stimulated by cytochrome b5 or by added FAD. These properties as well as the decreased efficiency of P450-1 and P450-2 in the mutants are consistent with the participation of cytochrome b5:NADH cytochrome b5 reductase as redox partner of the gibberellin monooxygenases in the absence of CPR. We provide evidence, from either incubations of GA12 (C-20 methyl) with cultures of the mutant suspended in [18O]H2O or maintained under an atmosphere of [18O]O2:N2 (20:80), that GA15 (C-20 alcohol) and GA24 (C-20 aldehyde) are formed directly from dioxygen and not from hydrolysis of covalently enzyme-bound intermediates. Thus these partially oxidized GAs correspond to intermediates of the sequential oxidation of C-20 catalyzed by P450-2.",

The structures of these new compounds were defined by spectroscopic analysis. All the compounds (1-13) isolated from P. grisea were tested against P 388, A 549, and HT 29 tumor cell lines. Compounds 3, 5/6, and 12 exhibited selective activity against the HT 29 cell line (ED(50) = 0.1 microg/ml).",

The structures of these compounds were elucidated using spectroscopic methods. The antioxidant activities of these isolated compounds were evaluated by colorimetric methods based on their scavenging effects on hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anion radicals, respectively. All the compounds showed potent antioxidative activities and the structure-activity relationship is discussed.",

Resinacein C was isolated from a natural source for the first time. The structures of all the above compounds were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis and comparisons of their spectroscopic data with those reported in the literature. Furthermore, in an in\u00a0vitro assay, Resinacein C, ganoderic acid Y, lucialdehyde C, 7-oxo-ganoderic acid Z3, 7-oxo-ganoderic acid Z, and lucidadiol showed strong inhibitory effects against \u03b1-glucosidase compared with the positive control drug acarbose. The structure-activity relationships of ganoderma triterpenes on \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition showed that the C-24/C-25 double bond is necessary for \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Moreover, the carboxylic acid group at C-26 and the hydroxy group at C-15 play important roles in enhancing inhibitory effects of these triterpenes.",

        "AbstractText": "Night-blooming water lilies are characterized by intense emission of floral VOCs. Their unique scent-oriented pollinators, cyclocephaline scarabs (Scarabaeidae, Cyclocephalini), are attracted to flowers that they use as reliable sources of food and as mating aggregation sites. Chemical analysis of floral scent samples of seven species of Nymphaea subg. Hydrocallis established remarkably simple fragrant blends, each of which was dominated by one or two prominent compounds that alone accounted for over 95% of total scent emission. A total of 22 VOCs were identified: aliphatics (9), C5-branched chain compounds (5) and aromatics (8). Anisole was the dominant constituent in the floral scents of Nymphaea amazonum subsp. amazonum, N. amazonum subsp. pedersenii and N. tenerinervia, whereas (methoxymethyl)benzene was the most abundant VOC in samples of N. lasiophylla and N. lingulata. Flowers of N. rudgeana and N. gardneriana emitted high amounts of methyl hexanoate and methyl 2-methylbutanoate. Comparisons of floral VOC composition including other day- and night-blooming species of Nymphaea and Victoria obtained from the literature evidenced disparities related to habitus. While flowers of day-blooming species mostly emit aromatic alcohols and ethers, nocturnal species are particularly rich in aromatic ethers, aliphatic esters and C5-branched chain esters. These findings strongly suggest that the floral scent composition within closely related Nymphaea and Victoria is linked to pollinator selection, and the putative role of floral VOCs in pollinator attractiveness is discussed.",

The liquid consists of a mixture of fatty acids, an ester, and a series of straight-chain aldehydes. Relative to the eggs of a congeneric chrysopid that lacks stalk fluid, the eggs of C. smithi proved well protected against ants. Components of the fluid, in an assay with a cockroach, proved potently irritant. Following emergence from the egg, C. smithi larvae imbibe the stalk fluid, thereby possibly deriving nutritive benefit, defensive advantage, or both.",

        "AbstractText": "A new griseofulvin derivative, 4'-demethoxy-4'-N-isopentylisogriseofulvin (1), three new indole alkaloids, 2-demethylcyclopiamide E (2), 2-demethylsperadine F (3), and clopiamine C (4), and five known metabolites (5-9) were isolated from Penicillium griseofulvum CPCC 400528. Compound 1 is the first reported griseofulvin analogue with an N-isopentane group and the first example of a naturally occurring N-containing griseofulvin analogue. Their structures and absolute configurations were elucidated through extensive spectroscopic analyses, calculated ECD, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Cu K\u03b1). The possible biogenetic pathway of 1-3 was proposed. Compounds 1, 2, and 5 exhibited anti-HIV activities with IC50 values of 33.2, 20.5, and 12.6 \u03bcM, respectively.",

The structures of these compounds were determined by spectroscopic analysis, and all were found to be novel. The compounds exhibited inhibitory activity against fungi, particularly Phytophthora sp., a plant pathogen of oomycetes. The inhibitory activity of these metabolites revealed the importance of the cyclic anhydride structure and the lipophilicity of the alkyl side chain. On the other hand, the cytotoxicity of the compounds against B16 melanoma cells indicated that the cyclic anhydride structure was not essential.",

Structures of the 20 compounds were elucidated by analysis of spectroscopic data. The absolute configuration of seven of these compounds was addressed by a single crystal X-ray analysis using CuK\u03b1 radiation and an estimate of the Flack parameter. Three compounds also possessed a tricyclic ring system. Terpene endoperoxides isolated exhibited cytotoxic activity, while those without an endoperoxide moiety did not show activity. The endoperoxide moiety of sesquiterpenes has significant impact on cytotoxic activity, and thus is an important functionality for cytotoxicity. One terpene endoperoxide displayed potent cytotoxic activity (IC50 0.28\u03bcM), and selectively exhibited activity against the HL-60 cell line.",

Neck tissue of S. nuttali contained saxitoxin (STX) and neoSTX (95% of the total toxicity), whereas the bodies contained neoSTX and a mixture of the gonyautoxins. In a sample of M. californianus the presence of neoSTX and the gonyautoxins was demonstrated, whereas a second sample, collected at a different site, contained almost exclusively neoSTX.",

One of them, bipinnapterolide A (5), is a new representative of the pseudopterane family of diterpenes possessing the rare 2,3-epoxy-1,4-dione moiety. The other metabolites, bipinnatins G-I (6-8) and bipinnatolides F-J (9-13), are highly oxygenated cembranolide diterpenes. Their chemical structures including relative stereochemistry were established by detailed analysis of the spectral data in addition to X-ray diffraction analysis and NMR spectral comparisons with known pseudopterane and cembranolide models.",

        "AbstractText": "Five novel lamellarin-class alkaloids have been isolated from a Great Barrier Reef ascidian, Didemnum chartaceum. The structures of the 20-sulfated derivatives of lamellarins B, C, and L (1-3); the 8-sulfated derivative of lamellarin G (4), plus a nonsulfated compound, lamellarin Z (5), were identified by interpretation of spectroscopic data. Lamellarin G 8-sulfate (4) is the first example of this class of compounds sulfated at the C-8 position, while lamellarin Z (5) is the first example of a dimethoxylated lamellarin. The known lamellarins A, B, C, E, G, and L (6-11), plus the triacetate derivatives of lamellarins D (12) and N (13), were also isolated. An aberration in the integration of signals in the 1H NMR spectra of the 20-sulfated derivatives of lamellarins B, C, and L (1-3) led to NMR relaxation studies. T1 values were calculated for all protons in the sulfated lamellarins (1-4) and their corresponding nonsulfated derivatives (7, 8, 10, 11). Interestingly, the protons ortho to the sulfate group in compounds (1-4) had T1 values up to five times larger than the corresponding protons in their nonsulfated derivatives (7, 8, 10, 11).",

        "AbstractText": "A recently described actinomycete species (Streptomyces araujoniae ASBV-1(T)) is effective against many phytopathogenic fungi. In this study, we evaluated the capacity of this species to inhibit Botrytis cinerea development in strawberry pseudofruit, and we identified the chemical structures of its bioactive compounds. An ethyl acetate crude extract (0.1 mg ml(-1)) of ASBV-1(T) fermentation broth completely inhibited fungus growth in strawberry pseudofruit under storage conditions. The crude extract was fractionated by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography; the active fraction was further evaluated by tandem mass spectrometry. ASBV-1(T) produced a multiantibiotic complex with ionophoric properties. This complex contained members of the macrotetralides class (including monactin, dinactin, trinactin, and tetranactin) and the cyclodepsipeptide valinomycin, all of which were active against B. cinerea. Furthermore, the addition of 2 mM MgSO4 and 1 mM ZnSO4 enhanced macrotetralide and valinomycin production, respectively, in the culture broth. These compounds are considered to be the main active molecules that S. araujoniae produces to control B. cinerea. Their low to moderate toxicity to humans and the environment justifies the application of ASBV-1(T) in biological control programs that aim to mitigate the damage caused by this phytopathogen.",

        "AbstractText": "Laminaria japonica L. is among the most commonly consumed seaweeds in northeast Asia. In the present study, L. japonica essential oil (LJEO) was extracted by microwave-hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. LJEO contained 21 volatile compounds, comprising 99.76% of the total volume of the essential oil, primarily tetradeconoic acid (51.75%), hexadecanoic acid (16.57%), (9Z,12Z)-9,12-Octadecadienoic acid (12.09%), and (9Z)-hexadec-9-enoic acid (9.25%). Evaluation of the antibacterial potential against three foodborne pathogens, Bacillus cereus ATCC 10876, Escherichia coli O157:H7 ATCC 43890, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 49444, revealed that LJEO at a concentration of 25 mg/paper disc exerted high antibacterial activity against S. aureus (11.5 \u00b1 0.58 mm inhibition zone) and B. cereus (10.5 \u00b1 0.57 mm inhibition zone), but no inhibition of E. coli O157:H7. LJEO also displayed DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging activity (80.45%), superoxide anion scavenging activity (54.03%), and ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radical and hydroxyl radical scavenging at 500 \u00b5g/mL. Finally, LJEO showed high inhibition of lipid peroxidation with strong reducing power. In conclusion, LJEO from edible seaweed is an inexpensive but favorable resource with strong antibacterial capacity as well as free radical scavenging and antioxidant activity; therefore, it has the potential for use in the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries.",

        "AbstractText": "Mithramycin is a glycosylated aromatic polyketide produced by Streptomyces argillaceus, and is used as an antitumor drug. Three genes (mtmV, mtmU and mtmC) from the mithramycin gene cluster have been cloned, and characterized by DNA sequencing and by analysis of the products that accumulate in nonproducing mutants, which were generated by insertional inactivation of these genes. The mtm V gene codes for a 2,3-dehydratase that catalyzes early and common steps in the biosynthesis of the three sugars found in mithramycin (D-olivose, D-oliose and D-mycarose); its inactivation caused the accumulation of the nonglycosylated intermediate premithramycinone. The mtmU gene codes for a 4-ketoreductase involved in D-oliose biosynthesis, and its inactivation resulted in the accumulation of premithramycinone and premithramycin A , the first glycosylated intermediate which contains a D-olivose unit. The third gene, mtmC, is involved in D-mycarose biosynthesis and codes for a C-methyltransferase. Two mutants with lesions in the mtmC gene accumulated mithramycin intermediates lacking the D-mycarose moiety but containing D-olivose units attached to C-12a in which the 4-keto group is unreduced. This suggests that mtmC could code for a second enzyme activity, probably a D-olivose 4-ketoreductase, and that the glycosyltransferase responsible for the incorporation of D-olivose (MtmGIV) shows some degree of flexibility with respect to its sugar co-substrate, since the 4-ketoanalog is also transferred. A pathway is proposed for the biosynthesis of the three sugar moieties in mithramycin.",

        "AbstractText": "The established tradition of consuming and marketing wild mushrooms has focused attention on mycotoxicity, which has become a global issue. In the present study, we describe the toxins found in a previously unknown poisonous European mushroom Tricholoma terreum. Fifteen new triterpenoids terreolides\u2005A-F (1-6) and saponaceolides\u2005H-P (8-16) were isolated from the fruiting bodies of the toxic mushroom T. terreum. Terreolides\u2005A-C (1-3) possessed a unique 5/6/7 trioxaspiroketal system, whereas terreolides D-F (4-6) possessed an unprecedented carbon skeleton. Two abundant compounds in the mushroom, saponaceolide\u2005B (7) and saponaceolide\u2005M (13), displayed acute toxicity, with LD50 values of 88.3 and 63.7\u2005mg\u2009kg(-1) when administered orally in mice. Both compounds were found to increase serum creatine kinase levels in mice, indicating that T. terreum may be the cause of mushroom poisoning ultimately leading to rhabdomyolysis.",

The conversions focused mainly on positions 3,7,11, and 24 with several oxidizing agents. A total of 18 compounds affected S. littoralis growth (IGR). Our results support the importance of the C-3 substituent, suggest the involvement of the C-7 substituent and indicate that the C-3 hydroxyl is not essential for the IGR effect. Overall, Sf9 cells were more sensitive to the active compounds than CHO cells. All of these compounds had non selective moderate phytotoxic effects on radicle elongation of L. sativa.",

        "AbstractText": "Resveratrol (RESV) is a plant polyphenol, which is thought to have beneficial metabolic effects in laboratory animals as well as in humans. Following oral administration, RESV is immediately catabolized, resulting in low bioavailability. This study compared RESV metabolites and their tissue distribution after oral uptake and skin absorption. Metabolomic analysis of various mouse tissues revealed that RESV can be absorbed and metabolized through skin. We detected sulfated and glucuronidated RESV metabolites, as well as dihydroresveratrol. These metabolites are thought to have lower pharmacological activity than RESV. Similar quantities of most RESV metabolites were observed 4 h after oral or skin administration, except that glucuronidated RESV metabolites were more abundant in skin after topical RESV application than after oral administration. This result is consistent with our finding of glucuronidated RESV metabolites in cultured skin cells. RESV applied to mouse ears significantly suppressed inflammation in the TPA inflammation model. The skin absorption route could be a complementary, potent way to achieve therapeutic effects with RESV.",

        "AbstractText": "Members of marine Actinobacteria have been highly regarded as potentially important sources of antimicrobial compounds. Here, we isolated a strain of Actinobacteria, SZJ61, and showed that it inhibits the in vitro growth of fungi pathogenic to plants. This new isolate was identified as Streptomyces luteoverticillatus by morphological, biochemical and genetic analyses. Antifungal compounds were isolated from S. luteoverticillatus strain SZJ61 and characterized as carbazomycin B by nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. We then sequenced the genome of the S. luteoverticillatus SZJ61 strain, which consists of only one 7,367,863\u00a0bp linear chromosome that has a G+C content of 72.05%. Thirty-five putative biosynthetic gene clusters for secondary metabolites, including a variety of bioactive products, were found. Mining of the genome sequence information revealed the putative biosynthetic gene cluster of carbazomycin B. This genomic information is valuable for interpreting the biosynthetic mechanisms of diverse bioactive compounds that have potential applications in the pharmaceutical industry.",

High-performance liquid chromatorgaphy with diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD) fingerprint of the methanol extracts allowed the definition of two main types of Algerian propolis (AP) directly related to their secondary metabolite composition. Investigation of two representative types of AP by preparative chromatographic procedure and mass spectrometric (MS) and NMR techniques led to the identification of their main constituents: caffeate esters and flavonoids from an AP type rich in phenolic compounds (PAP) and labdane and clerodane diterpenes, together with a polymethoxyflavonol, from an AP type containing mainly diterpenes (DAP). Subsequently, two specific HPLC-MS/MS methods for detection of PAP and DAP markers were developed to study the chemical composition of propolis samples of different north Algerian regions. Antioxidant activity of AP samples was evaluated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) assay, and a significant free-radical scavenging effect was observed for propolis of the PAP series rich in polyphenols.",

        "AbstractText": "Sixteen new compounds, comprising nine new plakortolides K-S (1-9), four seco-plakortolides (10-13), and three plakortones (14-16), were isolated from the Australian sponge Plakinastrella clathrata. Structural elucidation, including relative configurational assignment, was based on extensive spectroscopic analysis, while the absolute configurations of 1-4 were deduced from (1)H NMR analyses on MPA esters derived from Zn/AcOH reduction products. Diastereomeric sets of plakortolides, e.g., K and L, or M and N, differed in configuration at C-3/C-4 rather than at C-6, a stereochemical result that compromises a biosynthetic pathway involving Diels-Alder cycloaddition of molecular oxygen to a \u0394(3,5)-diunsaturated fatty acid precursor. The biosynthesis may plausibly involve cyclization of a 6-hydroperoxydienoic acid intermediate following stereospecific introduction of the hydroperoxy group into a polyketide-derived precursor. Isolated seco-plakortolides converted under mild conditions into plakortones with full retention of configuration, suggesting C-6 hydroxy attack on an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated lactone intermediate. The NMR data reported for the compound named plakortolide E are inconsistent with the current literature structure and are those of the corresponding seco-plakortolide (19). The reported conversion of the metabolite into a plakortone ether on storage is consistent with this structural revision.",

        "AbstractText": "The distinctive nature of the endophyte Irpex lacteus, host plant, and the phytopathogen Collectotrichum gloeosporioides resulted in both negative and positive regulation of the production of phytotoxins from Nigrospora oryzae. The coculture of nonhomologous I. lacteus and N. oryzae resulted in a greater number of anti-phytopathogenic metabolites from the dominant endophyte than the coculture of homologous I. lacteus and N. oryzae. The coculture of the phytopathogen N. oryzae and either the nonhomologous (isolation of I. lacteus and N. oryzae from the different plants) or homologous (isolation of I. lacteus and N. oryzae from the same plant) endophyte I. lacteus from different sources indicated that the nonhomologous I. lacteus grew faster than the homologous I. lacteus, and the production of phytotoxic azaphilone from the phytopathogenic N. oryzae decreased due to the inhibition resulting from being cocultured with nonhomologous I. lacteus. On the other hand, the production of phytotoxic azaphilone was promoted by the coculture of two phytopathogens, N. oryzae and C. gloeosporioides. The extract of the host plant, Dendrobium officinale, also increased anti-phytopathogenic metabolite production. Six new phytotoxic azaphilones from N. oryzae, four new tremulane sesquiterpenes from I. lacteus, and a new polyketone were isolated. The endophyte-phytopathogen, phytopathogen-phytopathogen, and endophyte-phytopathogen-host interactions can induce the chemical diversity of novel anti-phytopathogenic metabolites.",

        "AbstractText": "Ten compounds including nine phenalenone derivatives (five bipolarides and four bipolarols) and a sesterterpene acid (bipolarenic acid), were isolated from a marine isolated of the fungus Lophiostoma bipolare (BCC25910), along with the known compounds, (-)-scleroderolide, (-)-sclerodin, and oxasetin. Chemical structures were elucidated based on NMR spectroscopic data and HRESIMS analysis. In addition, the absolute configurations of the phenalenones were resolved using specific rotations and chemical means, while the relative configuration of bipolarenic acid was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. The compounds were evaluated for biological activity against the Plasmodium falciparum K-1 strain, Candida albicans, and Bacillus cereus, and for cytotoxicity against both cancerous and non-cancerous cells.",

        "AbstractText": "Nine new linear lipopeptides, microcolins E-M (1-9), together with four known related compounds, microcolins A-D (10-13), were isolated from the marine cyanobacterium Moorea producens using bioassay-guided and LC-MS/MS molecular networking approaches. Catalytic hydrogenation of microcolins A-D (10-13) yielded two known compounds, 3,4-dihydromicrocolins A and B (14, 15), and two new derivatives, 3,4-dihydromicrocolins C and D (16, 17), respectively. The structures of these new compounds were determined by a combination of spectroscopic and advanced Marfey's analysis. Structurally unusual amino acid units, 4-methyl-2-(methylamino)pent-3-enoic (Mpe) acid and 2-amino-4-methylhexanoic acid (N-Me-homoisoleucine), in compounds 1-3 and 8, respectively, are rare residues in naturally occurring peptides. These metabolites showed significant cytotoxic activity against H-460 human lung cancer cells with IC50 values ranging from 6 nM to 5.0 \u03bcM. The variations in structure and attendant biological activities provided fresh insights concerning structure-activity relationships for the microcolin class of lipopeptides.",

The compounds belong to the group of beta-methoxyacrylate (MOA) inhibitors and are related to the myxothiazols. The melithiazols show high antifungal activity, but are less toxic than myxothiazol A and its methyl ester in a growth inhibition assay with mouse cell cultures. The melithiazols inhibit NADH oxidation by submitochondrial particles from beef heart. Melithiazol A blocks the electron transport within the bc1-segment (complex III) and causes a red shift in the reduced spectrum of cytochrome b.",

        "AbstractText": "The products of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene, holA, from Paraburkholderia rhizoxinica were investigated using our recently established recombineering technique. Fifteen products, including 13 new linear lipopeptides, holrhizins E-Q (2-8, 10-15), together with the two known holrhizins A and B (1, 9), were detected in the activated mutant, and their structures were identified using HRESIMS, NMR spectroscopy, Marfey's analysis, and feeding experiments with labeled amino acids. The lipohexapeptides 1-3 and 7-14 differ in three amino acid residues and the N-terminal fatty acid chains. The diversity of the holrhizins originates from the substrate flexibility of the A4, A5, and A6 domains as well as the starter C domain in the biosynthetic pathway.",

        "AbstractText": "The new alkaloids marinacarbolines E-Q (1-10, 12-14), caerulomycin N (15), and actinoallonaphthyridine A (16), together with the known marinacarboline C (11) and cyanogramide (17), were isolated from the actinomycete Actinoalloteichus sp. ZZ1866. The structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated based on their HRESIMS data, extensive NMR spectroscopic analyses, Mosher's method, ECD calculations, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, and chemical degradation studies. Marinacarbolines E-L (1-8) share an indole-pyridone-imidazole tetracyclic skeleton, which is the first example of this kind of skeleton. Caerulomycin N (15) and cyanogramide (17) exhibited cytotoxic activity against both human glioma U251 and U87MG cells with IC50 values of 2.0-7.2 \u03bcM. Marinacarbolines E (1), G (3), I (5), and M (9) showed cytotoxic activity against U87MG cells with IC50 values of 2.3-8.9 \u03bcM.",

        "AbstractText": "A chemical investigation of the endolichenic fungus Aspergillus versicolor (125a), which was found in the lichen Lobaria quercizans, resulted in the isolation of four novel diphenyl ethers, named diorcinols F-H (1-3, resp.) and 3-methoxyviolaceol-II (4), eight new bisabolane sesquiterpenoids, named (-)-(R)-cyclo-hydroxysydonic acid (5), (-)-(7S,8R)-8-hydroxysydowic acid (6), (-)-(7R,10S)-10-hydroxysydowic acid (7), (-)-(7R,10R)-iso-10-hydroxysydowic acid (8), (-)-12-acetoxy-1-deoxysydonic acid (9), (-)-12-acetoxysydonic acid (10), (-)-12-hydroxysydonic acid (11), and (-)-(R)-11-dehydrosydonic acid (12), two new tris(pyrogallol ethers), named sydowiols D (13) and E (14), and fifteen known compounds, 15-29. All of the structures were determined by spectroscopic analyses, and a number of them were further identified through chemical transformations and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations. Preliminary bioassays of these isolates for the determination of their inhibitory activities against the fungus Candida albicans, and their cytotoxicities against the human cancer cell lines PC3, A549, A2780, MDA-MB-231, and HEPG2 were also evaluated.",

The structures of these compounds were determined by extensive spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic analysis, as well as Mosher's method. We revised the absolute configuration at C(23) in the side chain of some lanostanoids as a result of the Mosher's products of 1 (i.e., 1a and 1b). The cytotoxicities against selected cancer cells and the anti-inflammatory effects of these tested metabolites 1-7 were determined in vitro.",

The structures of the metabolites were elucidated based on extensive analyses of the spectroscopic data, and the configuration of 1 was resolved by quantum chemical calculations of NMR shifts and ECD spectra and comparisons to experimental data. Compound 1, containing a naphthoquinone-derived moiety substituted with a butenolide unit, represents a new modified naphthoquinone skeleton. Interestingly, the 5,7-dioxygenated chromone derivatives 2-13 possessed different alkyl acid or alkyl ester side chain lengths, and those with side chain lengths of seven carbon atoms were discovered from nature for the first time.

The secretions of the common caiman (C. crocodilus), the broad-snouted caiman (C. latirostris), the yacare caiman (C. yacare), the dwarf caiman (P. palpebrosus), and the smooth-fronted caiman (P. trigonatus) yielded a new family of 43 aliphatic carbonyl compounds that includes aldehydes, ketones, and beta-diketones with an ethyl branch adjacent to the carbonyl group. The identification of these glandular components and the syntheses and stereochemical investigations of selected compounds are described.",

        "AbstractText": "Phytochemical-mediated modulation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity may underlie many herb-drug interactions. Single-time point phenotypic metabolic ratios were used to determine whether long-term supplementation of goldenseal ( Hydrastis canadensis ), black cohosh ( Cimicifuga racemosa ), kava kava ( Piper methysticum ), or valerian ( Valeriana officinalis ) extracts affected CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4/5 activity. Twelve healthy volunteers (6 women) were randomly assigned to receive goldenseal, black cohosh, kava kava, or valerian for 28 days. For each subject, a 30-day washout period was interposed between each supplementation phase. Probe drug cocktails of midazolam and caffeine, followed 24 hours later by chlorzoxazone and debrisoquin (INN, debrisoquine), were administered before (baseline) and at the end of supplementation. Presupplementation and postsupplementation phenotypic trait measurements were determined for CYP3A4/5, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, and CYP2D6 by use of 1-hydroxymidazolam/midazolam serum ratios (1-hour sample), paraxanthine/caffeine serum ratios (6-hour sample), 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone/chlorzoxazone serum ratios (2-hour sample), and debrisoquin urinary recovery ratios (8-hour collection), respectively. The content of purported \"active\" phytochemicals was determined for each supplement. Comparisons of presupplementation and postsupplementation phenotypic ratio means revealed significant inhibition (approximately 40%) of CYP2D6 (difference, -0.228; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.268 to -0.188) and CYP3A4/5 (difference, -1.501; 95% CI, -1.840 to -1.163) activity for goldenseal. Kava produced significant reductions (approximately 40%) in CYP2E1 only (difference, -0.192; 95% CI, -0.325 to -0.060). Black cohosh also exhibited statistically significant inhibition of CYP2D6 (difference, -0.046; 95% CI, -0.085 to -0.007), but the magnitude of the effect (approximately 7%) did not appear to be clinically relevant. No significant changes in phenotypic ratios were observed for valerian. Botanical supplements containing goldenseal strongly inhibited CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 activity in vivo, whereas kava inhibited CYP2E1 and black cohosh weakly inhibited CYP2D6. Accordingly, serious adverse interactions may result from the concomitant ingestion of goldenseal supplements and drugs that are CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 substrates. Kava kava and black cohosh may interact with CYP2E1 and CYP2D6 substrates, respectively. Valerian appears to be less likely to produce CYP-mediated herb-drug interactions.",

The amount of each alkaloid was calculated by the relative ratio of the intensity of H-1 signal to the known amount of internal standard, 200 microg of anthracene. This method allows rapid determination of the quantity of four ephedrine alkaloids from Ephedra species.

Among others, a Coniothyrium sp., from E. perox, and a Microsphaeropsis sp., from M. incrustans, were isolated, cultured, and investigated for their biologically active secondary metabolite contents. The new compound microsphaeropsisin (1) together with the known compounds (R)-mellein (4), (3R,4S)-hydroxymellein (5), (3R,4R)-hydroxymellein (6), and 4, 8-dihydroxy-3,4-dihydro-2H-naphthalen-1-one (7) were isolated from the Microsphaeropsis sp. From culture extracts of the Coniothyrium sp., the new compounds (3S)-(3',5'-dihydroxyphenyl)butan-2-one (2) and 2-(1'(E)-propenyl)-octa-4(E),6(Z)-diene-1,2-diol (3), together with the six known metabolites (3R)-6-methoxymellein (8), (3R)-6-methoxy-7-chloromellein (9), cryptosporiopsinol (10), phenylethanol, (p-hydroxyphenyl)ethanol, and 2-(hydroxymethyl)furan, were obtained. All structures were determined using spectroscopic methods. With the exception of 3, all compounds were tested for their antimicrobial properties, and all but 10 demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity in agar diffusion assays.",

Evaluation of the antioxidative activity, conducted in vitro, by using electron spin resonance (ESR) and ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometric assays, showed that these isolated flavonoids possess strong antioxidative capabilities. Measurement of the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) values, against ABTS (2,2'-azinobis(3-ethyl-benzo-thiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radicals and phenyl-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN) azo initiator (AI) also showed strong anti-oxidative activity. The most powerful of the antioxidants was 2\"-O-(3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoyl) quercitrin (galloyl quercitrin). A combination of two flavonoid compounds was tested for synergistic anti-oxidative capacity, but no significant improvement was observed.",

These diterpenes are presumably metabolites of a Lissoclinum species of ascidian on which the molluscs have fed. The structures of the new compounds were determined by interpretation of their spectral data. Compounds 1 and 2 were found to be potent cytotoxins in the National Cancer Institute's screening panel of 60 tumor cell lines and showed some selectivity for melanomas. Two other samples exhibited solid tumor selectivity in a soft agar disk diffusion assay.",

        "AbstractText": "Cyanobactins are a large family of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified cyanopeptides (RiPPs). Thus far, over a hundred cyanobactins have been detected in different free-living and symbiotic cyanobacteria. The majority of these peptides have a cyclic structure. The occurrence of linear cyanobactins, aeruginosamides and virenamide, has been reported sporadically and in few cyanobacterial taxa. In the current work, the production of cyanobactins by Limnoraphis sp. CCNP1324, isolated from the brackish water Baltic Sea, has been studied for the first time. In the strain, eighteen new aeruginosamide (AEG) variants have been detected. These compounds are characterized by the presence of prenyl and thiazole groups. A common element of AEGs produced by Limnoraphis sp. CCNP1324 is the sequence of the three C-terminal residues containing proline, pyrrolidine and methyl ester of thiazolidyne-4-carboxylic acid (Pro-Pyr-TzlCOOMe) or thiazolidyne-4-carboxylic acid (Pro-Pyr-TzlCOOH). The aeruginosamides with methylhomotyrosine (MeHTyr1) and with the unidentified N-terminal amino acids showed strong cytotoxic activity against human breast cancer cells (T47D).",

        "AbstractText": "Two new triterpenes, 29-hydroxydehydrotumulosic acid (1) and 29-hydroxydehydropachymic acid (2), together with six known compounds, dehydropachymic acid (3), dehydrotumulosic acid (4), 29-hydroxypolyporenic acid C (5), polyporenic acid C (6), tumulosic acid (7), and pachymic acid (8), were isolated from the dried sclerotia of Poria cocos. In the in vitro bioassays, these isolated compounds reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, nitric oxide (NO) production from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells, with compounds 5 and 6, the IC(50) values of which were 16.8\u00b12.7 and 18.2\u00b13.3 \u03bcM, respectively, exhibiting the greatest inhibition activity. Further Western blot analysis conducted on cells pre-treated with compounds 5 and 6, and luciferase assays on activator protein 1-dependent gene expression revealed that the inhibited NO release was attributed to the reduced expression of iNOs (=inducible NO synthase) enzymes, which might be regulated via the blockade of activator protein-1 signaling pathway.",

In the current investigation eight more coumarins were identified by mass spectrometric techniques: the simple coumarins scopoletin, scoparone, and osthol, the linear furanocoumarins imperatorin and phellopterin, the angular furanocoumarins angelicin and pimpinellin, and the pyranocoumarin seselin. Five of these occur in Apium graveolens, and scopoletin, scoparone, and imperatorin were each found in three of the species examined. The co-occurrence of all these coumarins on the surface may be significant in communication between the plant and its environment.",

        "AbstractText": "Titer improvement is a constant requirement in the fermentation industry. The traditional method of \"random mutation and screening\" has been very effective despite the considerable amount of time and resources it demands. Rational metabolic engineering, with the use of recombinant DNA technology, provides a novel, alternative strategy for titer improvement that complements the empirical method used in industry. Manipulation of the specific regulatory systems that govern secondary metabolite production is an important aspect of metabolic engineering that can efficiently improve fermentation titers. In this review, we use examples from Streptomyces secondary metabolism, the most prolific source of clinically used drugs, to demonstrate the power and utility of exploiting natural regulatory networks, in particular pathway-specific regulators, for titer improvement. Efforts to improve the titers of fredericamycin, C-1027, platensimycin, and platencin in our lab are highlighted.",

        "AbstractText": "Streptomycetes are prolific sources of novel biologically active secondary metabolites with pharmaceutical potential. S. collinus T\u00fc 365 is a Streptomyces strain, isolated 1972 from Kouroussa (Guinea). It is best known as producer of the antibiotic kirromycin, an inhibitor of the protein biosynthesis interacting with elongation factor EF-Tu. Genome Mining revealed 32 gene clusters encoding the biosynthesis of diverse secondary metabolites in the genome of Streptomyces collinus T\u00fc 365, indicating an enormous biosynthetic potential of this strain. The structural diversity of secondary metabolisms predicted for S. collinus T\u00fc 365 includes PKS, NRPS, PKS-NRPS hybrids, a lanthipeptide, terpenes and siderophores. While some of these gene clusters were found to contain genes related to known secondary metabolites, which also could be detected in HPLC-MS analyses, most of the uncharacterized gene clusters are not expressed under standard laboratory conditions. With this study we aimed to characterize the genome information of S. collinus T\u00fc 365 to make use of gene clusters, which previously have not been described for this strain. We were able to connect the gene clusters of a lanthipeptide, a carotenoid, five terpenoid compounds, an ectoine, a siderophore and a spore pigment-associated gene cluster to their respective biosynthesis products.",

        "AbstractText": "A high-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization ion trap tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the robust profiling and characterization of biosynthetic congeners in the 2-deoxy-aminocyclitol istamycin pathway, from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces tenjimariensis ATCC 31603. Gradient elution on an Acquity CSH C18 column was performed with a gradient of 5\u00a0mM aqueous pentafluoropropionic acid and 50% acetonitrile. Sixteen natural istamycin congeners were profiled and quantified in descending order; istamycin A, istamycin B, istamycin A0 , istamycin B0, istamycin B1 , istamycin A1 , istamycin C, istamycin A2 , istamycin C1 , istamycin C0 , istamycin X0 , istamycin A3 , istamycin Y0 , istamycin B3 , and istamycin FU-10 plus istamycin AP. In addition, a total of five sets of 1- or 3-epimeric pairs were chromatographically separated using a macrocyclic glycopeptide-bonded chiral column. The lower limit of quantification of istamycin-A present in S. tenjimariensis fermentation was estimated to be 2.2\u00a0ng/mL. The simultaneous identification of a wide range of 2-deoxy-aminocyclitol-type istamycin profiles from bacterial fermentation was determined for the first time by employing high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry analysis and the separation of istamycin epimers.",

        "AbstractText": "The complete carotenoid composition of the thermophilic green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium tepidum strain TNO was determined by spectroscopic methods. Major carotenoids were four kinds of carotenes: gamma-carotene, chlorobactene, and their 1',2'-dihydro derivatives (1',2'-dihydro-gamma-carotene and 1',2'-dihydrochlorobactene). In lesser amounts, hydroxyl gamma-carotene, hydroxyl chlorobactene, and their glucoside fatty acid esters were found. The only esterified fatty acid present was laurate, and OH-chlorobactene glucoside laurate is a novel carotenoid. In other strains of C. tepidum, the same carotenoids were found, but the composition varied from strain to strain. The overall pigment composition in cells of strain TNO was 4 mol carotenoids and 40 mol bacteriochlorophyll c per mol bacteriochlorophyll a. The effects of nicotine on carotenoid biosynthesis in C. tepidum differed from those in the thermophilic green nonsulfur bacterium Chloroflexus aurantiacus.",

        "AbstractText": "A precursor application system was developed to allow the study of Erythrina alkaloid formation in Erythrina crista-galli. Fruit wall tissue of this species was recognized as the major site of alkaloid biosynthesis. The application of radioactively and 13C-labelled potential precursors showed that the hitherto assumed precursor (S)-norprotosinomenine was not incorporated into the Erythrina alkaloids. In contrast, (S)-coclaurine as well as (S)-norreticuline were metabolized to erythraline and erythrinine, respectively, suggesting that a coclaurine-norreticuline pathway is operative in Erythrina alkaloid formation. Feeding of [1-13C]-labelled (S)-norreticuline with subsequent NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that the resulting erythraline was exclusively labelled at position C-10. Therefore, the participation of a symmetrical intermediate of the diphenoquinone type in Erythrina alkaloid biosynthesis can be excluded.",

        "AbstractText": "ABSTRACT Nematicidal activity of essential oils extracted from 27 spices and aromatic plants were evaluated in vitro and in pot experiments. Twelve of the twenty-seven essential oils immobilized more than 80% of juveniles of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne javanica at a concentration of 1,000 mul/liter. At this concentration, most of these oils also inhibited nematode hatching. Essential oils of Carum carvi, Foeniculum vulgare, Mentha rotundifolia, and Mentha spicata showed the highest nematicidal activity among the in vitro tested oils. These oils and those from Origanum vulgare, O. syriacum, and Coridothymus capitatus mixed in sandy soil at concentrations of 100 and 200 mg/kg reduced the root galling of cucumber seedlings in pot experiments. The main components of these essential oils were tested for their nematicidal activity. Carvacrol, t-anethole, thymol, and (+)-carvone immobilized the juveniles and inhibited hatching at >125 mul/liter in vitro. Most of these components mixed in sandy soil at concentrations of 75 and 150 mg/kg reduced root galling of cucumber seedlings. In 3-liter pot experiments, nematicidal activity of the essential oils and their components was confirmed at 200 and 150 mg/kg, respectively. The results suggest that the essential oils and their main components may serve as nematicides.",

        "AbstractText": "Previous investigations of H. oreadica reported the presence of a wide spectrum of complex limonoids and dihydrocinnamic acids. Our interest in the Rutaceae motivated a reinvestigation of H. oreadica, H. brasiliana and H. superba searching for other secondary metabolites present in substantial amounts for taxonomic analysis. In a continuation of the investigation of the H. oreadica, three new limonoids have now been isolated 9\u03b1-hydroxyhortiolide A, 11\u03b2-hydroxyhortiolide C and 1(S*)-acetoxy-7(R*)-hydroxy-7-deoxoinchangin. All the isolated compounds from the Hortia species reinforce its position in the Rutaceae. With regard to limonoids the genus produces highly specialized compounds, whose structural variations do not occur in any other member of the Rutaceae, thus, it is evident from limonoid data that Hortia takes an isolated position within the family. In addition, H. superba afforded the unexpected coumarin 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen, which may not be a genuine natural product. Solid-state cross-polarisation/magic-angle-spinning 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, X-Ray fluorescence and Field-emission gun scanning electron microscopy experiments show that the Sephadex LH-20 was modified after treatment with NaOCl, suggesting that when xanthotoxin (8-methoxy-psoralen) was extracted from cleaning of the gel column, chlorination of the aromatic system occurred.",

The new metabolites were purified and their structures were determined as 11-hydroxylated aclacinomycin A, B and T by spectral analysis. This result indicated that the dnrF was stably expressed in the strain S. galilaeus ATCC 31133 to give rise to hybrid aclacinomycins. In addition, a new aclacinomycin analog named 11-hydroxyaclacinomycin X was isolated from the same culture. Its structure was elucidated as 2\"'-amino-11-hydroxyaclacinomycin Y. It showed strong cytotoxicity against several human tumor cell lines, especially leukemia and melanoma cell lines.",

        "AbstractText": "Microcystins are cyclic heptapeptides produced by a range of cyanobacteria. More than 150 microcystin analogues have been reported from cultures, algal blooms, or other contaminated samples. Relatively few analytical standards are available, making identification and quantitation of these toxins a challenge, even with LC-MS technology. We developed a two-step oxidative procedure that allows LC-MS identification of microcystins containing methionine and methionine sulfoxide, and reveals the oxidation state of the methionyl sulfur atom. The procedure was used in parallel with mercaptoethanol derivatization and LC-MS(2) analysis to demonstrate the presence of [Asp(3)]MC-MR (12) and MC-MR (17) in a culture of Dolichospermum flos-aquae, together with low levels of [Asp(3)]MC-M(O)R (5) and MC-M(O)R (7), as well as 20 other microcystins. Fresh culture contained only traces of sulfoxides 5 and 7, but these increased during storage or sample extraction and preparation. This suggests that microcystins containing methionine sulfoxide are primarily postextraction oxidation artifacts, rather than being produced by biosynthesis in cyanobacteria. A simple, rapid extraction under inert gas followed promptly by LC-MS analysis minimized oxidation artifacts for D. flos-aquae.",

The strongly antineoplastic polyether macrocyclic lactones halichondrin B (1) and homohalichondrin B (2) were isolated in 1.2 x 10(-6)% and 5.4 x 10(-7)% yields, respectively. In addition to axinastatin 1 (3), two new and cytostatic (GI50 values of 0.35 to 0.0072 microgram/mL against six human cancer cell lines) cycloheptapeptides designated axinastatins 2 (4) and 3 (5) were discovered in 1.4 x 10(-6)% and 1.25 x 10(-6)% yields. Structures were elucidated by high-resolution FABMS and tandem MS/MS techniques augmented by high-field (400 and 500 MHz) 2D-NMR spectral analyses. The absolute configurations were established by a combination of hydrolysis, derivatization, and chiral gas chromatographic methods.",

        "AbstractText": "The present study was undertaken to assess and compare the in vitro cytotoxic effects of three resin acid analogues: dehydrobietic acid, podocarpic acid, O-methylpodocarpic acid; an essential oil from Australia (tea tree oil); and tapped oleoresin from Thailand, on human epithelial and fibroblast cells, using a quantitative neutral red spectrophotometric assay. All of the investigated compounds except for tea tree oil exhibited a cytotoxic activity which was proportional to their concentrations and time of exposure up to 24 h, i.e. higher concentrations and longer time of exposure caused increased cell death. Dehydroabietic acid and the oleoresin were the most toxic compounds followed by O-methylpodocarpic acid, whereas podocarpic acid and tea tree oil showed a lower level of toxicity. On the basis on these findings it is concluded that an isopropyl group on the aromatic C-ring is of great importance for the cytotoxicity of the tested abietane resin acids, thus indicating that the cytotoxic activity of oleoresins most probably is caused by synergistic or additive effects of resin acids. The results from this work support the view that antibacterial activity parallels cytotoxic activity which suggests a similar mode of action, most probably exerted by membrane-associated reactions.",

        "AbstractText": "Ustilago species produce an extracellular oil that shows activity in various pharmaceutical assays. We isolated several complexes of this heterogeneous glycolipid from cultures of Ustilago maydis DSM 11494 and Geotrichum candidum ST 002515, and determined the chemical structures of these new compounds, termed ustilipids, on the basis of NMR experiments, mass spectra, and fatty acid analyses. They all possess a 4-O-beta-D-mannopyranosyl D-erythritol basic framework, the configuration of which was confirmed, after initial solvolysis, by a single-crystal X-ray structure analysis. All the investigated ustilipids and related compounds are similarly constructed: the three hydroxy groups of the erythritol side chain are free in all cases, whereas the hydroxy groups of the mannose residue are for the most part acylated. Medium-chain fatty acids have for the first time been detected as components of glycolipids produced by Ustilaginales. While the 2-hydroxy group of the mannose residue is esterified with a C2-C8 carboxylate side chain, the 3-hydroxy group is in all cases esterified by a longer, C12-C20 fatty acid residue. The oxygen functionalities at the 4 and 6 positions are either acetylated or present as free hydroxy groups. Ustilipids antagonize dopamine D3 receptors in micromolar quantities; other members of this class of compounds have been found to possess an inhibitory action on the neurotensin receptor. The hemolytic activity of ustilipids is low.",

        "AbstractText": "Inhibition of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cells was assessed with an enzyme immunoassay following treatments with Echinacea extracts or synthesized alkamides. Results indicated that ethanol extracts diluted in media to a concentration of 15 microg/mL from E. angustifolia, E. pallida, E. simulata, and E. sanguinea significantly inhibited PGE2 production. In further studies, PGE2 production was significantly reduced by all synthesized alkamides assayed at 50 microM, by Bauer alkamides 8, 12A analogue, and 14, Chen alkamide 2, and Chen alkamide 2 analogue at 25 microM and by Bauer alkamide 14 at 10 microM. Cytotoxicity did not play a role in the noted reduction of PGE2 production in either the Echinacea extracts or synthesized alkamides. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis identified individual alkamides present at concentrations below 2.8 microM in the extracts from the six Echinacea species (15 microg/mL crude extract). Because active extracts contained <2.8 microM of specific alkamide and the results showed that synthetic alkamides must have a minimum concentration of 10 microM to inhibit PGE2, it is likely that alkamides may contribute toward the anti-inflammatory activity of Echinacea in a synergistic or additive manner.",

        "AbstractText": "Benzomalvin A (1), quinolactacins A1 (2), A2 (3) and B (4), quinolonimide (5), asperphenamate (6), and a new halogenated polyhydroxyanthraquinone, namely 2-chloro-6-[2'(S)-hydroxypropyl]-1,3,8-trihydroxy-anthraquinone (7), were isolated from an organic extract obtained from the solid culture of Penicillium spathulatum B35. Compounds 2 and 3 were isolated as an epimeric mixture, and compound 4 as a racemate. The structure of 7 was elucidated using 1D and 2D NMR, combined with computational methods (density functional theory). Compound 1, the mixture of 2 and 3, racemate 4, and compound 6 inhibited the yeast \u03b1-glucosidase in a concentration-dependent fashion with IC50 values of 383.2, 273.3, 57.3, and 8.3\u2009\u00b5M, respectively. The \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory properties of 1 were confirmed in vivo with an oral sucrose tolerance test in normal and hyperglycemic mice (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Furthermore, docking studies predicted that the most stable conformers of 1 bind to yeast and mammalian \u03b1-glucosidases with a higher affinity than acarbose. Finally, 1 also showed antihyperalgesic activity when tested in the formalin assay in hyperglycemic mice (p\u2009<\u20090.05).",

        "AbstractText": "Trichorovins (TV)-I-XIV are new antibiotic peptides obtained from conidia of the fungus Trichoderma viride. The peptide mixture of TVs was repeatedly fractionated by preparative HPLC until individual TVs showed a single peak on their analytical HPLC chromatograms. Nevertheless, FAB-MS or NMR indicated that each of TVs-I-XIV was composed of at least two components. We attempted to elucidate their structures within the fractions by electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS, FAB-MS, FAB-MS/MS and NMR. TVs generally have molecular weights of approximately 1100-1200 Da, and are characterized by an acetylated N-terminus, the presence of an aminoalcohol, e.g. leucinol, isoleucinol or valinol, at the C-terminus, and eleven residues including three alpha-aminoisobutyric acids in the molecule. Thus, it was determined that TVs belong to the class of peptaibols.",

Desotamide C (3) contains a unique N-formyl-kynurenine residue, whereas 4 lacks formylation at the same site. Compounds 1 and 2 displayed notable antibacterial activities against strains of Streptococcus pnuemoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), and structure activity relationship studies revealed the indispensability of the Trp component for antibacterial activity within this new scaffold.",

        "AbstractText": "Brominated indole alkaloids are a common class of metabolites reported from sponges of the order Verongida. Herein we report the isolation, structure determination, and activity of metabolites from three Florida sponges, namely, Verongula rigida (order Verongida, family Aplysinidae), Smenospongia aurea, and S. cerebriformis (order Dictyoceratida, family Thorectidae). All three species were investigated chemically, revealing similarities in secondary metabolites. Brominated compounds, as well as sesquiterpene quinones and hydroquinones, were identified from both V. rigida and S. aurea despite their apparent taxonomic differences at the ordinal level. Similar metabolites found in these distinct sponge species of two different genera provide evidence for a microbial origin of the metabolites. Isolated compounds were evaluated in the Porsolt forced swim test (FST) and the chick anxiety-depression continuum model. Among the isolated compounds, 5,6-dibromo- N,N-dimethyltryptamine ( 1) exhibited significant antidepressant-like action in the rodent FST model, while 5-bromo- N,N-dimethyltryptamine ( 2) caused significant reduction of locomotor activity indicative of a potential sedative action. The current study provides ample evidence that marine natural products with the diversity of brominated marine alkaloids will provide potential leads for antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs.",

        "AbstractText": "Actinobacteria from the unique intertidal ecosystem of the mangroves are known to produce novel, bioactive secondary metabolites. A novel strain known as MUSC 136(T) (=DSM 100712(T)\u2009= MCCC 1K01246(T)) which was isolated from Malaysian mangrove forest soil has proven to be no exception. Assessed by a polyphasic approach, its taxonomy showed a range of phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic properties consistent with the genus of Streptomyces. Phylogenetically, highest similarity was to Streptomyces misionensis NBRC 13063(T) (99.6%) along with two other strains (>98.9% sequence similarities). The DNA-DNA relatedness between MUSC 136(T) and these type strains ranged from 22.7 \u00b1 0.5% to 46.5 \u00b1 0.2%. Overall, polyphasic approach studies indicated this strain represents a novel species, for which the name Streptomyces malaysiense sp. nov. is proposed. The potential bioactivities of this strain were explored by means of antioxidant and cytotoxic assays. Intriguingly, MUSC 136(T) exhibited strong antioxidative activities as evaluated by a panel of antioxidant assays. It was also found to possess high cytotoxic effect against HCT-116 cells, which probably mediated through altering p53 protein and intracellular glutathione levels. Chemical analysis of the extract using GC-MS further affirms that the strain produces chemopreventive related metabolites.",

Except for juglone and 7-methyl-juglone, these compounds also had slight mutagenic effects on strain TA98 with S9 mix. All the mutagenic naphthoquinones contain one or two hydroxyl and/or methyl substituents. The naphthoquinone mompain, which has four hydroxyl groups, was not mutagenic. Unsubstituted beta-naphthoquinone, naphthoquinones with a prenyl side chain and all bi-naphthoquinone derivatives tested were non-mutagenic. None of the 13 benzoquinones examined was mutagenic to any of the strains used with or without metabolic activation. These results show that natural naphthoquinones are mutagenic when they have only one or two hydroxyl and/or methyl substituents.",

Complete 2D NMR assignments for the known metabolites lenoremycin (9) and lenoremycin sodium salt (10) were also provided for the first time. Comparative analysis also provided the basis for structural revision of several previously reported putative aziridine-containing compounds [exemplified by madurastatins A1, B1, C1 (also known as MBJ-0034), and MBJ-0035] as phenol-dihydrooxazoles. Bioactivity analysis [including antibacterial, antifungal, cancer cell line cytotoxicity, unfolded protein response (UPR) modulation, and EtOH damage neuroprotection] revealed 2 and 5 as potent neuroprotectives and lenoremycin (9) and its sodium salt (10) as potent UPR modulators, highlighting new functions for phenol-oxazolines/salicylates and polyether pharmacophores.",

        "AbstractText": "Thalassospiramides A and B are immunosuppressant cyclic lipopeptides first reported from the marine \u03b1-proteobacterium Thalassospira sp. CNJ-328. We describe here the discovery and characterization of an extended family of 14 new analogues from four Tistrella and Thalassospira isolates. These potent calpain 1 protease inhibitors belong to six structure classes in which the length and composition of the acylpeptide side chain varies extensively. Genomic sequence analysis of the thalassospiramide-producing microbes revealed related, genus-specific biosynthetic loci encoding hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthases consistent with thalassospiramide assembly. The bioinformatics analysis of the gene clusters suggests that structural diversity, which ranges from the 803.4 Da thalassospiramide C to the 1291.7 Da thalassospiramide F, results from a complex sequence of reactions involving amino acid substrate channeling and enzymatic multimodule skipping and iteration. Preliminary biochemical analysis of the N-terminal nonribosomal peptide synthetase module from the Thalassospira TtcA megasynthase supports a biosynthetic model in which in cis amino acid activation competes with in trans activation to increase the range of amino acid substrates incorporated at the N terminus.",

Chemical structures were determined based on spectroscopic evidence, including 1D, 2D NMR, and mass spectral data. Furthermore, all isolates were tested for cytotoxic activity and induction ability of hPXR-mediated CYP3A4 expression. Among them, ganoderic acid Jc (3) displayed selective inhibitory activity against HL-60 cells (IC\u2085\u2080 = 8.30 \u00b5M), and ganoderiol E (11) exhibited selective cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 cells (IC\u2085\u2080 = 6.35 \u00b5M). Meanwhile, compounds 5, 7, and ganolucidic acids B and C (19, 20) showed induction ability of hPXR-mediated CYP3A4 expression.",

        "AbstractText": "O-Methylated phenylpropanoids, which are generally present in small amounts in plants, have improved or distinct biological activities and pharmacological properties as opposed to their unmethylated counterparts. Although microbial production could be a useful tool for the efficient and environment-friendly production of methylated phenylpropanoids, a high-yield microbial production of neither tri-methylated stilbenes nor di-/tri-methylated flavonoids has been achieved to date. A methyltransferase from Streptomyces avermitilis (SaOMT2), which has been known to possess 7-O-methylation activity toward several flavonoids, exhibited more diverse regiospecificity and catalyzed mono-, di-, and tri-methylation of stilbene, flavanone, and flavone when it was expressed in Streptomyces venezuelae. For the efficient production of multi-methylated phenylpropanoids, a cocultivation system was developed by employing engineered Escherichia coli strains producing pterostilbene, naringenin, and apigenin, respectively, along with SaOMT2-expressing S. venezuelae mutant. Consequently, high-yield microbial production of tri-methylated stilbenes and di-/tri-methylated flavonoids (including 3,5,4'-trimethoxystilbene, 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxyflavanone, 4'-hydroxy-5,7-dimethoxyflavanone, 5,7,4'-trimethoxyflavanone, 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxyflavone, and 5,7,4'-trimethoxyflavone) has been demonstrated for the first time. This cocultivation system based on the phenylpropanoid-producing E. coli and SaOMT2-expressing S. venezuelae provides an efficient tool for producing scarce and potentially valuable multi-methylated phenylpropanoids and will enable further development of these compounds as pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals.",

This study reports the isolation of Streptomyces sp. MUM273b from mangrove soil that may serve as a promising source of antioxidants and UV-protective agents. Identification and characterization methods determine that strain MUM273b belongs to the genus Streptomyces. The MUM273b extract exhibits antioxidant activities, including DPPH, ABTS, and superoxide radical scavenging activities and also metal-chelating activity. The MUM273b extract was also shown to inhibit the production of malondialdehyde in metal-induced lipid peroxidation. Strong correlation between the antioxidant activities and the total phenolic content of MUM273b extract was shown. In addition, MUM273b extract exhibited cytoprotective effect on the UVB-induced cell death in HaCaT keratinocytes. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis detected phenolics, pyrrole, pyrazine, ester, and cyclic dipeptides in MUM273b extract. In summary, Streptomyces MUM273b extract portrays an exciting avenue for future antioxidative drugs and cosmeceuticals development.",

        "AbstractText": "A marine fungal isolate, tentatively identified as Fusarium heterosporum, has been found to produce a series of structurally novel sesterterpene polyols, the mangicols A-G (4-10). The structures of the new compounds, including the stereochemistry of mangicol A, were assigned by interpretation of spectral data derived from both natural products and synthetic derivatives. The mangicols, which possess unprecedented spirotricyclic skeletal components, show only weak to modest cytotoxicities toward a variety of cancer cell lines in in vitro testing. Mangicols A and B, however, showed significant antiinflammatory activity in the PMA (phorbol myristate acetate)-induced mouse ear edema model. A biosynthetic pathway for the neomangicol and mangicol carbon skeletons is proposed on the basis of the incorporation of appropriate radiolabeled precursors.",

        "AbstractText": "Low-nutrient media and long incubation times facilitated the cultivation of 20 taxonomically diverse Gram-negative marine bacteria within the phyla Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. These strains comprise as many as three new families and include members of clades that had only been observed using culture-independent techniques. Chemical studies of the type strains representing two new families within the order Cytophagales led to the isolation of nine new alkaloid secondary metabolites that can be grouped into four distinct structure classes, including azepinones, aziridines, quinolones, and pyrazinones. Several of these compounds possess antibacterial properties and appear, on structural grounds, to be produced by amino acid-based biosynthetic pathways. Our results demonstrate that relatively simple cultivation techniques can lead to the isolation of new bacterial taxa that are capable of the production of alkaloid secondary metabolites with antibacterial activities. These findings support continued investment in cultivation techniques as a method for natural product discovery.",

        "AbstractText": "Many important toxins and antibiotics are produced by non-ribosomal biosynthetic pathways. Microcystins are a chemically diverse family of potent peptide toxins and the end-products of a hybrid NRPS and PKS secondary metabolic pathway. They are produced by a variety of cyanobacteria and are responsible for the poisoning of humans as well as the deaths of wild and domestic animals around the world. The chemical diversity of the microcystin family is attributed to a number of genetic events that have resulted in the diversification of the pathway for microcystin assembly. Here, we show that independent evolutionary events affecting the substrate specificity of the microcystin biosynthetic pathway have resulted in convergence on a rare [D-Leu(1)] microcystin-LR chemical variant. We detected this rare microcystin variant from strains of the distantly related genera Microcystis, Nostoc, and Phormidium. Phylogenetic analysis performed using sequences of the catalytic domains within the mcy gene cluster demonstrated a clear recombination pattern in the adenylation domain phylogenetic tree. We found evidence for conversion of the gene encoding the McyA(2) adenylation domain in strains of the genera Nostoc and Phormidium. However, point mutations affecting the substrate-binding sequence motifs of the McyA(2) adenylation domain were associated with the change in substrate specificity in two strains of Microcystis. In addition to the main [D-Leu(1)] microcystin-LR variant, these two strains produced a new microcystin that was identified as [Met(1)] microcystin-LR. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that both point mutations and gene conversion result in functional mcy gene clusters that produce the same rare [D-Leu(1)] variant of microcystin in strains of the genera Microcystis, Nostoc, and Phormidium. Engineering pathways to produce recombinant non-ribosomal peptides could provide new natural products or increase the activity of known compounds. Our results suggest that the replacement of entire adenylation domains could be a more successful strategy to obtain higher specificity in the modification of the non-ribosomal peptides than point mutations.",

        "AbstractText": "Extracts of Garcinia mangostana (Guttiferae) showing inhibitory effects against the growth of S. aureus NIHJ 209p were fractionated according to guidance obtained from bioassay and some of the components with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were characterized. One active isolate, alpha-mangostin, a xanthone derivative, had a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1.57-12.5 micrograms mL-1. Other related xanthones were also examined to determine their anti-MRSA activity. Rubraxanthone, which was isolated from Garcinia dioica and has a structure similar to that of alpha-mangostin, had the highest activity against staphylococcal strains (MIC = 0.31-1.25 micrograms mL-1), an activity which was greater than that of the antibiotic vancomycin (3.13-6.25 micrograms mL-1). The inhibitory effect against strains of MRSA of two of the compounds when used in conjunction with other antibiotics was also studied. The anti-MRSA activity of alpha-mangostin was clearly increased by the presence of vancomycin; this behaviour was not observed for rubraxanthone. The strong in-vitro antibacterial activity of xanthone derivatives against both methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus suggests the compounds might find wide pharmaceutical use.",

        "AbstractText": "To expand the capabilities of whole-cell biocatalysis, we have engineered Escherichia coli to produce various esters. The alcohol O-acyltransferase (ATF) class of enzyme uses acyl-CoA units for ester formation. The release of free CoA upon esterification with an alcohol provides the free energy to facilitate ester formation. The diversity of CoA molecules found in nature in combination with various alcohol biosynthetic pathways allows for the biosynthesis of a multitude of esters. Small to medium volatile esters have extensive applications in the flavor, fragrance, cosmetic, solvent, paint and coating industries. The present work enables the production of these compounds by designing several ester pathways in E. coli. The engineered pathways generated acetate esters of ethyl, propyl, isobutyl, 2-methyl-1-butyl, 3-methyl-1-butyl and 2-phenylethyl alcohols. In particular, we achieved high-level production of isobutyl acetate from glucose (17.2 g l(-1)). This strategy was expanded to realize pathways for tetradecyl acetate and several isobutyrate esters.",

        "AbstractText": "Cyanobacteria from underexplored and extreme habitats are attracting increasing attention in the search for new bioactive substances. However, cyanobacterial communities from tropical and subtropical regions are still largely unknown, especially with respect to metabolite production. Among the structurally diverse secondary metabolites produced by these organisms, peptides are by far the most frequently described structures. In this work, liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization coupled to high resolution quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry with positive ion detection was applied to study the peptide profile of a group of cyanobacteria isolated from the Southeastern Brazilian coastal forest. A total of 38 peptides belonging to three different families (anabaenopeptins, aeruginosins, and cyanopeptolins) were detected in the extracts. Of the 38 peptides, 37 were detected here for the first time. New structural features were proposed based on mass accuracy data and isotopic patterns derived from full scan and MS/MS spectra. Interestingly, of the 40 surveyed strains only nine were confirmed to be peptide producers; all of these strains belonged to the order Nostocales (three Nostoc sp., two Desmonostoc sp. and four Brasilonema sp.).",

Among marine microorganisms, dinoflagellates have proved to be important sources of marine toxins and have been investigated worldwide by natural product chemists. We have continued investigations on chemically interesting and biologically significant secondary metabolites from Amphidinium spp., of a genus of symbiotic marine dinoflagellates separated from inside cells of Okinawan marine flatworms. This review covers the results described in our recent publications on a series of cytotoxic macrolides, designated amphidinolides, and long-chain polyketides isolated from Amphidinium spp. In this review, topics include the isolation, structure elucidation, synthesis, biosynthesis, and bioactivity of amphidinolides and long-chain polyketides.",
